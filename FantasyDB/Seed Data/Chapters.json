        "ChapterText": "<p>Dawn had barely broken when the thunderous knocking shattered the morning silence. Moren’s heart lurched as someone flung open the kitchen door downstairs with a bang. He heard shouts, heavy footsteps trudging up the narrow wooden staircase.</p><p><br></p><p>Barely a breath later, the silhouettes of two guards filled the frame of his bedroom door. His daughter Siva, that had been sleeping peacefully curled up in his arms a moment ago, clutched her doll closer, her young eyes widening with fear. Before Moren could react, rough hands seized him, pulled him up from his bed and pinned his arms behind his back. He struggled; his eyes locked on Siva as the guard grabbed her. “Papa!” she screamed, reaching out towards him.</p><p><br></p><p>They pushed him down the staircase; he tumbled into his kitchen and landed roughly on the stone floor, a splitting pain shot through his head, and he felt dizzy. He tried to look around, tried to see what was going on, how many there were, tried to remember what had happened the day before that had given them away.</p><p><br></p><p>Before he could gather his thoughts, the guards seized him and forcefully pulled him out through the front door, onto the porch, and into the dusty streets. His desperate pleas for mercy drowned in the jeers of the crowd that had gathered. The town square, usually a place of commerce and laughter, had transformed into a theater of justice; or so the Church proclaimed. They had erected stakes in the center, which stood ominously and cruelly against the pale morning sky.</p><p><br></p><p>The guard that had grabbed his little girl strode past him, holding Siva by her wrist. He could see her struggling against their grip. He marched her to the stakes and tied her to one of them, her slight frame swallowed by the rough ropes he wound around her. Moren’s voice broke as he shouted and threw his weight against the guards holding him, trying to get to her, but the guard forced him to his knees with a kick to the legs and held his head up by the hair, forcing him to witness the horror unfolding.</p><p><br></p><p>The Inquisitor stepped forward, his voice booming as he declared the charges against the three accused women and children standing bound to the stakes. “Witchcraft! Wild magic! An abomination and an attack against the Divine Light!” He wrapped his hand around the tar-soaked tip of the torch he was holding. He seemed to whisper to it, then it burst into flames. The crowd cheered; their faces twisted in a macabre grin of righteousness. Moren’s desperate howls mingled with Siva’s whimpering.</p><p><br></p><p>“No, please, not my little girl!” His voice was raw. “This is not justice!”</p><p>“Shut it!” a guard snarled at him and kicked him square in the head.</p><p>His vision blurred, but he kept struggling and screaming, clenching his fists.</p><p>“I. Said. Shut. It.” He punctuated each word with a blow to Moren’s head.</p><p><br></p><p>The last thing he saw was the torch moving towards his daughter. The last thing he heard was Siva’s screaming. Her cry pierced his heart like a dagger. The last thing he felt was a searing heat that pushed through the square as his daughter’s terror erupted, raw and uncontrollable.</p><p><br></p><p>A ripple that knocked the guards back and extinguished the torches of onlookers. Moren felt it in his chest, like his heart stumbled, and he tasted burning wood. His vision blurred around the edges, and he felt darkness creeping over him. His eyes closed, and he fell into helpless, broken unconsciousness. As he woke, the smell of burned flesh overwhelmed his senses. A vile testament to the cruelty humanity was capable of. His eyes stung, and he was covered in ash. He tried to sit up but failed. The spectacle was over. The fires had turned to swirling clouds of dust.</p><p><br></p><p>The crowd had dispersed, their thirst for justice satiated, their hearts untouched by the brutality they had just witnessed. Moren crawled to the blackened stake his daughter had been tied to. There were no tears left in him to fall on the charred ground that held her remains. “I’m so sorry,” he murmured, choking on dry sobs. His hands dug into the still hot dirt as if he could somehow uncover something of her that was not ravaged by flames.</p><p><br></p><p>He curled up on the pile of ashes that was slowly carried away by the wind. Moren’s life as he knew it had ended with hers. What was left was a shell, a father haunted by the echoes of his daughter’s screams, his very soul scorched by the righteous fires of the faith’s justice. He heard heavy steps approaching, but he couldn’t move, couldn’t care. He felt something heavy strike his head, and he collapsed into darkness.</p>",

        "ToDo": "<p>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points • Establishes the world’s dangers immediately—magic is a crime punishable by death. • Introduces the Church as an overwhelming, unquestioned authority. • Sets up Moren’s loss and later motivation for rebellion. • Shows how deeply ingrained the Church’s doctrine is—the crowd cheers. Conflicts &amp; Obstacles • Moren is outnumbered and powerless. • The Church has absolute control over public perception. • The pyres symbolize the erasure of Wild Magic. Moren’s Emotional &amp; Psychological Change • Starts as a father protecting his daughter, by the end, he is a broken man. • His faith in people is shattered. • His rage and grief fuel his later role in resistance. High Moment / Key Visuals (What the Reader Sees &amp; Feels) The fire ignites. Moren screams, trying to break free. Siva’s terror surges—an unseen force ripples through the air. The torches of the crowd flicker, snuffed out for a brief moment. Then the flames roar, drowning everything. Moren is struck down, the world fading into darkness. Hidden Truths (What the Reader Doesn’t Know Yet) • Siva was never burned • The Church stole Siva, faking her death. • She is renamed Lia and raised as a Divine Magician in the Order of Flame • Moren passes out before seeing what really happened. Ending Scene Visual (Final Moments of the Chapter) Moren’s body lies in the ashes, unmoving. The morning sun rises over Sovalis, cold and indifferent. The square is empty now, except for the smoldering remains of the stakes. The world moves on. But for Moren, nothing will ever be the same. Questions for Refinement 1. Do you want to hint at the moment Siva is taken (a shadowy figure, a brief glimpse of a hooded Church member), or completely conceal it until later? 2. Should Moren have one last whispered word or thought before losing consciousness? 3. Do you want to show more of the Inquisitor and his role, or keep him a faceless embodiment of the Church’s will?</p>"

His kingdom is uneasy—small <strong>uprisings</strong> have broken out in the countryside, driven by <strong>fear and resentment toward the Church’s growing authority.</strong> More disturbing are the <strong>reports of strange natural occurrences—violent storms, sudden droughts, rivers flooding at the wrong season.</strong> The advisors argue over whether this is <strong>divine punishment</strong> or the result of <strong>magicians tampering with nature.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Among them is <strong>Inquisitor Varick</strong>, a sharp, ambitious clergyman who has steadily gained influence in court. He is <strong>composed, confident, and persuasive</strong>, his words laced with subtle threats and reassurances. He argues that the <strong>only way to protect the kingdom from further chaos is to give the Order of Flame unrestricted authority to root out Wild Magicians before their influence spreads.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The council is divided, some hesitant to grant the Church more power, others seeing it as a necessity. The king listens, silent for most of the debate. He is already leaning toward <strong>allowing the Inquisitors more freedom</strong>, but he does not want to appear weak.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick presses his advantage, subtly framing this decision as <strong>not just a political necessity, but a father’s duty</strong>. He reminds Alistair that <strong>the future king must inherit a kingdom that is stable, unchallenged by rogue magicians and rebels.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">At last, the king speaks. <strong>The Order of Flame will have fewer restrictions. Their reach will extend beyond just towns and cities—they will be allowed to investigate rural villages, noble estates, even the outskirts of Sovalis itself.</strong> The council is dismissed, and the king lingers, staring into the fire, the weight of his decision pressing down on him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The scene ends on a <strong>somber note</strong>—he tells himself he is doing this for his son, but <strong>there is an undeniable unease growing in his heart.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Introduces Inquisitor Varick</strong>, an influential clergyman and political manipulator.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Establishes <strong>rising unrest in the kingdom</strong>—the public is uneasy with the Church’s growing control.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Highlights <strong>the first signs of magical imbalance</strong>—the environment itself is responding to the persecution of magic.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>King Alistair grants the Order of Flame greater freedom</strong>, setting the stage for the <strong>Church’s rise to near-total authority.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Conflicts &amp; Obstacles</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>council is divided</strong>—some believe in controlling magic, others worry about unchecked Church power.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>King fears losing control</strong>, torn between his personal doubts and political necessity.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Varick subtly manipulates the king</strong>, framing the decision as protecting his son’s legacy.</span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>How the Scene Changes the King</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair enters the meeting <strong>already worried but still in control.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He leaves <strong>having given up a significant amount of power to the Church, something he will later regret.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His <strong>justification—that this is for his son—feels hollow, but he clings to it.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>High Moment / Key Info Revealed</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Natural disasters are worsening</strong>, signaling that magic itself is being thrown off balance.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Order of Flame is given greater authority</strong>, marking the next phase in the Church’s consolidation of power.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Varick is rising in influence</strong>, positioning himself as <strong>the king’s most trusted advisor</strong>.</span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visual (Final Moments of the Scene)</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The council chamber empties, but the king remains seated.

Mirah stands at the hearth, stirring with slow, practiced movements, her rounded belly making even simple motions feel heavier. Aelius enters, brushing specks of charcoal from his hands and beard, his fingers still stained with the ink and paint of the day’s work.

Moren sits at the table, his fingers wrapped around a cup, but he hasn’t taken a sip. His coat is dusted with travel, his boots still damp with the mud of Sovalis’ streets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Across from him, <strong>Aelius and Mirah speak in hushed voices</strong>, their conversation careful, heavy. The topic is one they’ve avoided for weeks—<strong>should they leave the city before it’s too late?</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Moren, any word from the north? We’ve been thinking about heading that way...”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Moren, who had just been holding his cup without drinking, sets it down too hard, <strong>tea sloshing over his fingers.</strong> “Sorry,” he mumbles, wiping his hands on his trousers. He looks <strong>weary, his eyes shadowed.</strong> “I wouldn’t. Not now. It’s bad up there, Aelius. Really bad. The Wittshires tried last spring, remember? They’ve...” His voice trails off, and he swallows hard. “They didn’t make it. All of them, gone. Even the little one.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah gasps, <strong>covering her mouth with a trembling hand.</strong> “That’s horrific. To think they didn’t even spare the child...”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius looks down, his jaw tightening. <strong>He had already heard rumors in the city today—of another family, another set of arrests.</strong> The noose is tightening.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Moren exhales, rubbing a hand down his face. “Someone must have talked.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah shudders, wrapping her arms around herself. <strong>“So nowhere is safe.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius’ voice is grim. “Not unless we find people who can be trusted.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They speak of allies, of <strong>whether fleeing is still an option, if it ever was.</strong> But Moren doesn’t have good news. The <strong>King has given the Church free reign</strong>, and the Order of Flame has only tightened its grip. Wild Magicians <strong>are being hunted with more precision than ever before.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The conversation <strong>darkens, turns bitter.</strong> <strong>Aelius grows cynical</strong>, shaking his head at the futility of it all. Mirah, however, turns quiet—<strong>not bitter, but afraid.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The kitchen falls silent.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Upstairs, where she had been <strong>giggling and playing with Jona</strong>, Arana has gone still. She has crept to the staircase, <strong>listening.</strong> She doesn’t understand much, but the voices are different. Not like when her father tells stories, not like when her mother hums while stirring soup. <strong>The laughter is gone, and the bitterness in the voices below sinks into her, even if she cannot name it.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Aelius and Mirah seriously consider leaving Sovalis,</strong> but Moren warns them it’s too dangerous.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Wittshire family’s fate foreshadows what is coming.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Order of Flame is becoming more organized, suggesting someone is giving them information.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Moren urges caution—nowhere is safe, but careful alliances might help.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Arana overhears, planting the first seed of unease in her young mind.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Conflicts &amp; Obstacles</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>No clear path forward.</strong> Fleeing is risky, but staying might be worse.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Fear of betrayal—someone is giving names to the Order.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Arana overhears, too young to understand but old enough to feel the weight of it.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>How This Scene Changes the Characters</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Aelius becomes more bitter, convinced there’s no way out.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Mirah becomes more anxious, realizing they cannot keep ignoring the danger.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Arana experiences fear for the first time,</strong> though she does not yet understand why.</span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>High Moment / Key Info Revealed</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Wittshire family, who tried to escape, were all caught and killed.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Nowhere is safe, not even the north.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>There are still potential allies, but trust is scarce.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visual</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Later, as dusk settles and Moren readies to leave, he lingers at the door, speaking quietly to Aelius and Mirah.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Keep your eyes open. Stay safe.

The heaviness in the air lingers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">That night, as Mirah tucks Arana into bed, her embrace is <strong>tighter than usual, protective.</strong> Her lips press against her daughter’s forehead, whispering, <strong>“Sleep well, my Little Star.”</strong> Her voice is thick, <strong>as if she is trying to shield her child from the weight of what remains unsaid.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana falls asleep with her mother’s warmth around her, but outside, <strong>the city’s shadows stretch longer than before.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Questions for Refinement</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Do you want <strong>Arana to question her mother about the conversation later</strong>, or should she silently keep the unease to herself?</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Should <strong>Moren reveal something even more unsettling</strong>, perhaps about how the Order of Flame is tracking Magicians more efficiently than before?</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Would you like <strong>Aelius and Mirah to argue privately afterward</strong>, revealing their growing disagreement on how to protect their family?</span></p></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 8: The Knock at the Door</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> Moren’s Home, Sovalis, Lower City<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Late Night<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Late Summer, Fram Month<br><strong>Weather:</strong> The city is quiet, the air thick with humidity, a distant storm looming<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Moren<br><strong>Time Passed Since Previous Scene:</strong> A few hours</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Scene Summary</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Moren sat at his small kitchen table, fingers wrapped around a cup of warm tea, its steam curling softly in the dim light of the room. He had just returned from Aelius and Mirah’s home, his mind <strong>filled with thoughts of how to get them out before it was too late.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His hands ached, not from the journey but from the weight of his own helplessness. He had met with members of the <strong>resistance just last week</strong>, a scattered network of those still fighting against the Church’s growing tyranny. <strong>If he could connect Aelius and Mirah with them, maybe they’d have a chance.</strong> Maybe little Arana wouldn’t end up like so many others—alone, hunted. <strong>Like his own daughter.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The thought was a wound that never closed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then came the knock.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A sequence of heavy thuds, too forceful, too deliberate. The sound <strong>sent ice down Moren’s spine.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He had heard that knock before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Three years ago. The night his daughter was taken.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The tea cup clattered from his hands, spilling across the worn wood of the table as he stood, heart hammering against his ribs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The door <strong>burst open before he could take a step.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Armed men flooded into the room, clad in dark city watch uniforms, the insignia of the <strong>Order of Flame</strong> stitched onto their shoulders.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Moren barely had time to <strong>raise his hands before they were on him.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A heavy hand seized his arm, twisting it behind his back. Another <strong>yanked him forward, forcing him onto his knees.</strong> The rough fibers of a rope burned against his wrists as they <strong>bound him fast.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You have no right!” Moren growled, struggling against their grip. His voice was steady, but his pulse was a wild drumbeat in his ears.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The leader of the group stepped forward, his face unreadable, his voice cold and methodical. <strong>“Recent amendments to the law of our King now make it a crime to withhold information regarding the whereabouts of known magicians.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He unrolled a parchment, reading with crisp efficiency.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>“You, Moren Thumber, have associated closely with the convicted witches Lila and Siva Thumber, and are hereby arrested for aiding and abetting in their crimes.”</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Moren’s breath caught. <strong>Lila and Siva.</strong> His wife. His daughter.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His anger surged, but <strong>he knew better than to fight.</strong> Against two guards in full armor, he had no chance. He clenched his teeth as they dragged him toward the door.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His house—his home—blurred in his vision as they hauled him away. <strong>He knew he would never see it again.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Moren is arrested under new laws targeting anyone associated with Wild Magicians.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Order of Flame is escalating its persecution,</strong> tightening its grip over the city.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The king’s decree is being weaponized against even those with distant connections to magic.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Moren’s knowledge of Aelius and Mirah’s magic puts them at greater risk.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Conflicts &amp; Obstacles</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Moren is arrested without trial or evidence,</strong> only the vague accusation of association.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>His attempt to protect Aelius and Mirah is cut short.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The city remains silent—no one will speak against the guards.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>How This Scene Changes the Characters</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Moren loses what little safety he had left.</strong> He is now a direct target of the Church.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>His fate foreshadows what will happen to Aelius and Mirah if they do not escape.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>High Moment / Key Info Revealed</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Order of Flame is becoming more efficient—someone is informing them.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The people of Sovalis have become too afraid to resist.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visual</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The city is dark, but <strong>curtains shift in nearby houses, shadows watching but never interfering.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The guards <strong>march Moren through the streets, their armor clinking against the stone.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>He does not look back.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 9: The Holding Cell</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> Holding Facility, Sovalis<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Early Morning<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Late Summer, Fram Month<br><strong>Weather:</strong> A restless wind stirs outside, the air thick with the promise of rain<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Moren<br><strong>Time Passed Since Previous Scene:</strong> A few hours</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Scene Summary</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The cell was <strong>small, cold, and smelled of damp stone.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Moren sat on the rough wooden bench, wrists still aching from the ropes. Across from him, <strong>three other prisoners stared in quiet resignation.</strong> He had never seen them before, but he already knew why they were here.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Association with convicted magicians?” he muttered, rubbing his raw wrists.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They all nodded.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Beside one of the prisoners—a young woman—<strong>a child no older than six clung to her arm, his small face pale with fear.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Moren exhaled slowly, anger simmering just beneath his exhaustion. “This is madness.” He looked toward the iron-barred door, <strong>toward the laughter of the guards drinking in the next room.</strong> They were celebrating another <strong>successful haul.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He shook his head, voice low. “They don’t even think anymore.

The Church’s reach now touched every corner of his kingdom, and he was no longer certain whether he led <strong>them, or they led him.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>advisor on cultural control</strong> rose next.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Public burnings of troubling books have purified homes and libraries, <strong>eradicating dangerous ideas that once threatened to mislead your people.</strong> The once-common healers, now recognized as practitioners of dark arts, have been <strong>rightfully accused and removed</strong> from our communities. These actions have reinforced the moral and spiritual purity of Veridian.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Burnings. Erasures. Vanishing knowledge.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair clenched his jaw but <strong>gave no outward sign of his unease.</strong> It had to be done. These were the necessary prices for unity.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>judicial advisor</strong> stepped forward.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“The integration of the Church’s authority with the royal legal system has been seamless, Your Majesty. Minor disputes are now adjudicated under the watchful eyes of clerical councils, which <strong>judiciously apply divine law.</strong> This has significantly reduced petty squabbles and instilled a profound respect for divine order throughout the kingdom.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A perfect system, they called it. But Alistair was not so certain.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>advisor on land and farming</strong> spoke last, addressing the <strong>natural disasters that continued to plague the land.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“The increase in natural calamities, from floods to earthquakes, clearly demonstrates the <strong>desperate backlash of magicians against our efforts.</strong> These events, while challenging, <strong>only affirm the necessity of our actions.</strong> These divine messages have <strong>rallied our people, strengthening their faith and their resolve</strong> to stand with us against the darkness.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair’s fingers curled slightly against the armrest of his chair.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>How convenient that every failure of nature could be pinned upon their enemies.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The reports continued, each advisor speaking of <strong>the hard-won victories for stability and divine order.</strong> Alistair listened, his expression unreadable, his silence masking the storm of thoughts within him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">When the last voice fell silent, he straightened slightly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“These reports affirm our path,” he stated, his voice carrying across the chamber. “We must <strong>continue to guard against the heretics and infidels with unwavering resolve.</strong> My kingdom’s future, <strong>my son’s</strong> kingdom’s future, depends on the sanctity and security we uphold today.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A chorus of <strong>affirmations</strong> followed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Yet <strong>as the council dispersed</strong>, Alistair remained seated. He stared down at the <strong>wax seal on the parchment before him</strong>, stamped with the insignia of the Order of Flame.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>For all the security they had achieved, why did his kingdom still feel so fragile?</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Veridian has fully transformed into a theocracy.</strong> The Church now controls not only faith but <strong>law, education, medicine, and public discourse.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Order of Flame has reached peak authority.</strong> Their <strong>checkpoints, oaths, and public purges</strong> are now seen as normal.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Natural disasters are worsening, but the Church frames them as proof of their righteousness.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>King Alistair has secured his throne—but has he lost control to the Church?</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Conflicts &amp; Obstacles</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Alistair’s growing doubt.</strong> He does not regret enforcing order, but <strong>he fears what it is becoming.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Order of Flame is not just a tool—</strong> it is a force that <strong>may be slipping beyond his control.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The kingdom may be more “secure,” but the tension has not lifted—only deepened.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>How This Scene Changes the King</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He begins <strong>resolute, confident in his reign.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">By the end, <strong>a seed of doubt lingers.</strong> His kingdom is strong, yet <strong>he does not feel at ease.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>High Moment / Key Info Revealed</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The people are more devout, but out of fear, not faith.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The destruction of knowledge is systematic—history itself is being rewritten.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Alistair realizes, perhaps too late, that the Church does not need him as much as he once believed.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visual</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The council chamber <strong>empties</strong>, but the king remains seated.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The wax seal on the parchment <strong>feels heavier than it should.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The faint sound of <strong>thunder in the distance.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Questions for Refinement</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Would you like to introduce <strong>a single dissenting voice within the council,</strong> a noble or advisor hesitant about the Church’s growing control?</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Should there be <strong>more explicit signs of the king’s doubt,</strong> or should it remain subtle for now?</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Would you like <strong>an external event to interrupt the meeting,</strong> perhaps news of an escaped magician or an unexpected rebellion?</span></p></li></ol>",

The magic didn’t work, and I got upset. Can you forgive me?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hesitated for only a moment, then <strong>nodded.</strong> “It’s okay, Papa. Can we bring the fire back?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius’ smile <strong>didn’t quite reach his eyes,</strong> but he nodded. “Of course we can.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This time, when he raised his hand, the fire <strong>relit itself effortlessly</strong>, as though nothing had ever been wrong.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The room <strong>was warm again, full of flickering light and crackling heat.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But <strong>Arana noticed things more now.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The quiet

serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> Aelius and Mirah’s Home, Sovalis<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Late Afternoon<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Autumn, Gila Month<br><strong>Weather:</strong> A soft, steady drizzle outside, filling the air with the scent of damp earth<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Arana (child’s perspective)<br><strong>Time Passed Since Previous Scene:</strong> A few days</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Scene Summary</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana sat near the hearth, watching the rhythmic motion of <strong>her mother’s hands at the sewing machine.</strong> The needle dipped and rose, a quiet clicking sound filling the space as Mirah guided the fabric beneath her fingers with precision. <strong>It was mesmerizing.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana had always thought her mother’s sewing was more than just skill. <strong>The clothes she made never tore easily, the seams never came undone.</strong> Even when the other children in the neighborhood wore patches on their sleeves, Arana’s own dresses stayed whole, <strong>as if the fabric had been stitched with something stronger than thread.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Was it magic?</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She knew better than to ask.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Keep breathing, then,” her father would tease sometimes when he watched Mirah work, <strong>suggesting that her very breath must be weaving the fabric together.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana had started watching for it—<strong>the little moments where her mother’s fingers lingered over a stitch, the subtle shift in the air.</strong> The way the cloth seemed to settle, as if responding to her mother’s touch.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But Mirah’s magic was not like her father’s. There were no sparks, no sudden bursts of fire. <strong>Her mother’s magic was quiet, hidden—woven into the ordinary.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">More than that, <strong>her mother’s magic was careful.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Observations from a Child’s Eyes</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana didn’t remember when it had started, exactly. <strong>The way her mother seemed to avoid taking her to the market anymore.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She missed those trips—the colors, the voices, the sticky sweetness of candied nuts sold at the corner stall. But she did not miss the way her mother’s <strong>hand would grip hers too tightly</strong>, fingers tense around her wrist, <strong>her eyes darting constantly, watching the crowd.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Now, her mother always found a neighbor to watch her instead. <strong>The market had become something too dangerous, too unpredictable.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Even now, sitting at the table, <strong>Arana could see it.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her mother’s hands never trembled. Her stitches never faltered. <strong>But there was something in the way her shoulders carried a tension that never fully faded.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Fear. Not the sharp kind that came with sudden danger—<strong>the slow, suffocating kind. The kind that settled into your bones and never quite left.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>An Evening of Lightness</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The smell of <strong>freshly baked pie</strong> filled the kitchen as the sky outside darkened, the rain tapering off into mist. The table was warm, filled with the quiet clinking of utensils, <strong>the murmurs of laughter.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Did everything stay calm in the kitchen today? No runaway fires?” Mirah asked, nudging Aelius playfully.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>giggled</strong>, stealing a glance at her father. <strong>Earlier that day, he had burned one of his sketches</strong>—a tiny, misdirected spark from his quill <strong>scorching the edges of the paper.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“No fires today, Mama,” she reassured, <strong>grinning.</strong> “And Papa promised to start teaching me how to draw!”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“That’s right,” Aelius said, smiling warmly at her. “We’ll begin with simple lines and shapes. And your mother will make sure we have sturdy aprons—just in case we get a little too artistic.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah <strong>raised a playful brow.</strong> “Absolutely.

Her husband was taken last week.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius tensed, fingers tightening around his cup. <strong>He had already heard the rumors.</strong> But hearing them confirmed sent a cold thread of unease through him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Jora too,”</strong> he muttered. <strong>“I still can’t believe it.”</strong> He let out a sharp breath, shaking his head. <strong>“Those Inquisitors… twisting magic into a weapon to hunt us. Calling it righteous. Calling it divine.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah let out a humorless laugh. <strong>“They call it divine magic now, sanctioned by the church. Nothing wicked about it in their minds.”</strong> Her lips curled in disdain. <strong>“As if magic chooses its bearers based on men’s decrees.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius exhaled through his nose, his jaw tight. <strong>“They’re coming closer, Mirah.”</strong> His voice was quieter now, heavier. <strong>“Every whispered spell, every minor charm could be a noose around our necks. And just as every spell held back is.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah reached across the table, her fingers <strong>finding his, a warm contrast to the cold fear settling in his bones.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“We need to be more cautious,” he said. <strong>“Especially around Arana. She’s still so young, so unaware of what this means.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah’s grip tightened slightly. <strong>“We’ve taught her to keep our magic a secret, but she doesn’t understand why yet.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She paused, staring down at the wood grain of the table. <strong>“She might not even have it, Aelius. She might have been spared.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius let out a quiet, bitter chuckle. <strong>“You know that’s unlikely.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah swallowed, her throat tight. <strong>She did know.</strong> They would find out in a few years—when Arana turned ten.

Find somewhere safer.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah sighed. <strong>“Perhaps. But where?”</strong> She shook her head. <strong>“The Order is reaching beyond the cities. There are rumors of villages being purged.

The scent of roasted nuts and honey cakes filled the air as noble guests arrived in their finest attire. <strong>Musicians played a light, cheerful melody, and entertainers wove through the crowds, dazzling children and adults alike with their tricks.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was <strong>Prince Edric’s sixth birthday</strong>, and the kingdom had gathered to celebrate.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Young <strong>Edric stood at the heart of it all</strong>, dressed in a finely embroidered tunic, <strong>his golden curls gleaming in the sunlight.</strong> He greeted the lords and ladies with polite nods, just as he had been taught. But despite the grandeur around him, <strong>his attention kept slipping elsewhere.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A butterfly—<strong>a brilliant blue flash among the flower beds</strong>—drifted past him. Without hesitation, <strong>Edric darted after it, weaving between the nobles with the ease of a child who had never known restraint.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Lady Tharston, a noblewoman with an opulent hat, chuckled. <strong>“The young prince certainly looks the part today.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Indeed,” her husband agreed, watching Edric twirl beneath the falling leaves, <strong>his laughter unburdened, unspoiled.</strong> “He carries the hopes of Veridian with such ease.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A few steps away, a visiting dignitary observed the scene, his gaze thoughtful. <strong>“Look at him—completely unaware of what he will become.”</strong> He sighed. “It is in these small moments that we remember the purity of youth, before the weight of crowns dulls the light in their eyes.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Another courtier, a duchess from Brama, murmured <strong>“He has his mother’s spirit.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Yes,” Sir Gellantara replied. “And let’s hope he inherits her wisdom, too. He’ll need it, given what lies ahead.”</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Edric’s Bond with Animals</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric was <strong>a prince, but more often than not, his companions were not other noble children but the creatures that roamed the palace grounds.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>He sought the quiet places</strong>—the hidden nooks of the garden, the still corners of the orchards where the birds gathered, the kennels where the palace hounds lay.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">After <strong>the formalities of cake, songs, and speeches</strong>—none of which he truly understood—<strong>Edric slipped away from the main festivities</strong>, seeking something more familiar. He removed his fine shoes, stepping onto the cool grass, and wandered toward the hound enclosures.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The guards who followed him at a respectful distance <strong>exchanged amused glances</strong>, knowing his habits well.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">As he approached, the hounds—usually disciplined and reserved—<strong>perked up instantly.</strong> Their tails wagged, their ears pricked forward, and <strong>one by one, they pressed against the gates, whining softly.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The moment Edric touched the latch, the hounds burst free.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Rather than scatter, <strong>they circled him, tails wagging, playful but gentle.</strong> The onlookers chuckled at the sight, nobles commenting on how charming the young prince looked <strong>amidst the creatures that adored him.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“He’s always been fond of them,” one guest remarked. <strong>“No doubt he sneaks them treats from the kitchens.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Another laughed. <strong>“It’s no wonder the animals adore him—he treats them as friends, not servants.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Even the birds seemed to take notice.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A <strong>small sparrow fluttered down</strong>, landing lightly on Edric’s shoulder. Then another. And another. The prince <strong>giggled in delight</strong>, tilting his head as if listening to their delicate songs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“The birds probably think he’s part of the garden itself,” someone mused.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">To Edric, this was <strong>simply how things were.</strong> He had never known a world where animals did not trust him, where creatures did not respond to his presence with ease.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Day’s End</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">As the sun dipped lower, painting the sky in hues of amber and violet, the celebration wound down. The guests lingered over their last cups of wine, <strong>watching as Edric lay in the grass, surrounded by the hounds, his eyes fixed on the sky.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father was inside, speaking with his council. His future was being discussed, decisions being made. <strong>But Edric did not think of that.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">For now, he only thought of the rustling leaves, the warmth of the hounds at his side, and the feeling of <strong>belonging—not to a crown, but to something simpler.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp;

The air smelled like roasted nuts and fresh bread, and Arana breathed it in, eyes darting between bright fabrics and baskets of glossy fruit.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It had been so long since she’d been allowed to come along. She wasn’t going to waste it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her father walked ahead, a bundle of wrapped supplies tucked under one arm, his eyes always moving. Watching. Her mother’s hand was firm in hers, not too tight, but enough to keep her close.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">There was too much to see.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She lagged half a step behind, trying to get a better look at a cluster of brightly colored ribbons hanging from a stall. The wind tugged at them, making them flutter like little birds caught in a net. She wanted to stop, just for a moment—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Someone slammed into her shoulder.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She barely had time to yelp before the world tipped, and then she was falling, scraping against the rough stone. A sharp sting tore up her hands and knees, and she sucked in a breath—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A shadow moved over her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Hey,” her father’s voice cut through the noise, cold and sharp. “Watch where you’re going.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana looked up. The man who had knocked into her barely spared her a glance. He was big, bigger than her father, with thick arms and a stained tunic, the scent of sweat and fish clinging to him like a second skin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Not my problem,” the man muttered, already turning away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her father took a step forward.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah’s grip on Arana tightened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Let it go,” she said softly, tugging him back.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius didn’t move.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The man scoffed. “Control your brat,” he said, shaking his head like they weren’t worth his time.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The space between them turned hot.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not like the midday sun. Not like the warm breeze rolling in from the docks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A flicker of heat.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The scent of something just starting to burn.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The man stumbled back with a startled grunt, his boots scraping against the stone. He patted at his tunic, his face scrunching in confusion like he thought a coal had jumped from a brazier onto his chest.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah’s fingers dug into Aelius’s wrist.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Aelius,” she whispered, urgent and firm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His jaw was tight, his breath shallow. Arana could see his fingers twitch, just slightly, before he curled them into a fist. The warmth in the air faded, but it left something uneasy in its wake.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The man shot him a glare but didn’t linger, muttering under his breath as he turned and disappeared into the crowd.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s mother let out a breath like she’d been holding it too long. Then she laughed, quick and airy, like she could shake it all off. “Gods, people are so rude these days,” she said, kneeling to dust off Arana’s scraped palms. “We should send a petition. Mandatory etiquette lessons at the docks.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her voice was light, teasing, but her hands were shaking just a little.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana didn’t move, didn’t speak.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had seen something.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Felt something.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The heat. The way the air had changed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The way her father had looked—how his shoulders had gone rigid, how his fingers had curled.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius didn’t laugh.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Let’s go,” he said, voice tight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He pulled Arana to her feet, turned, and walked. Mirah took Arana’s hand again, her grip still gentle, but this time it felt different.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The market noise swallowed them whole again, folding around them like nothing had happened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But Arana kept stealing glances at her father’s back as they walked.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Weight of Something Unspoken</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The three of them walked quickly, too quickly for it to be normal. Mirah kept talking, voice light, filling the space with small things—“Should’ve bought those peaches,” “Hope the butcher still has good cuts left,” “You alright, love? You took a nasty fall.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana nodded when she was supposed to. Answered when she was supposed to.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she felt something twisting inside her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had seen something.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Something that shouldn’t have happened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wanted to ask. To say something. But the way her father walked, stiff and silent, kept the words locked in her throat.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She looked down at her scraped palms, flexing her fingers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her mother gave her hand a squeeze, but Arana barely felt it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her father had told her before—<strong>never in front of people. Never where someone might see.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her heart beat a little faster.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They had seen.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Hadn’t they?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">No shouts had followed. No cries of alarm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The city had swallowed it whole, the way it swallowed everything.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But something about the way her father hadn’t looked at her since made her stomach feel heavy.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visuals:</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius walking ahead, his posture stiff, his knuckles white around the bundle of supplies.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah smiling, talking like nothing had happened, but her grip on Arana’s hand still a little too tight.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana staring at her scraped palms, the lingering warmth still fresh in her memory.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The crowded market swallowing them up again, the noise and movement pressing in around them like a shield.</span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>What This Scene Accomplishes:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Shifts focus to Arana’s perspective as a five-year-old</strong>—she doesn’t fully understand what happened, but she knows it was wrong.<br><strong>Mirah trying to de-escalate with humor and small talk</strong>—she doesn’t want to make it a bigger moment, but the tension is still there.<br><strong>Hints at Arana feeling uneasy, but never outright stating guilt</strong>—the weight is left lingering in her chest, not forced onto the reader.<br><strong>Keeps Aelius silent, reinforcing the tension without explanation.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Refinement Questions:</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Does this subtle approach work, or should there be a stronger emotional reaction from Arana?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Does Mirah’s attempt at de-escalation feel natural, or should she be more obviously nervous?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Should Aelius have one final line before they reach home, or is his silence more effective?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Would you like more of Arana’s internal thoughts as they walk, or is the current amount of uncertainty enough?</strong></span></p></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">&nbsp;</span></p><hr><h2><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Chapter 6: The End of Innocence</span></h2><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 1: A Day Like Any Other</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> The Market District, Sovalis<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Late Afternoon<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Autumn, Heno Month<br><strong>Weather:</strong> A crisp breeze, carrying the scent of spices and freshly baked bread<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Arana (child’s perspective)<br><strong>Time Passed Since Previous Scene:</strong> A few weeks</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The market was <strong>alive with sound and scent</strong>, voices overlapping in a constant hum as merchants called out their wares.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Fresh honey cakes!

But her gaze soon drifted <strong>to the next stall over, where pastries dusted in fine sugar sparkled like fairy dust.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,

Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah <strong>tightened her grip on Arana’s hand</strong>, drawing her close. “Stay by me, love.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>clung to her mother’s skirt</strong>, her heart <strong>thudding.</strong></span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 3: The Inquisitor Arrives</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>mood of the market shifted</strong>—laughter fading, conversations quieting.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">At the <strong>market’s edge</strong>, <strong>four armored guards appeared</strong>, their presence like a dark stain on the day’s light.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And at their center, <strong>a towering figure in blackened steel.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">An <strong>Inquisitor.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His <strong>deep red cloak</strong> flowed behind him, its edges embroidered in gold, <strong>the mark of the Order of Flame.</strong> A <strong>thick ring of bloodred stone gleamed on his finger</strong>, catching the dying sunlight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He <strong>raised his hand</strong>, and <strong>all eyes turned toward him.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“By the authority of the Order of Flame,” his voice <strong>boomed</strong>, carrying effortlessly across the square, “granted by His Royal Holiness our King and guided by the grace of the Divine Light—”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A pause.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I declare the arrest of these practitioners of forbidden arts.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He lowered his hand, <strong>and pointed directly at them.</strong></span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 4: The Choice to Run</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius and Mirah <strong>exchanged a single look.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">One glance was all it took.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“We need to move,” Aelius whispered.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But Mirah <strong>knew better.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was <strong>too late.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The exits were <strong>blocked</strong>. More guards <strong>closed in.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah’s grip <strong>tightened on Arana.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then, with a swift motion, <strong>she shoved her daughter backward.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>stumbled into an empty side street</strong>, behind a stack of wooden crates.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Stay here. Do not move. Do not make a sound.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her mother’s voice was urgent, <strong>but soft.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mirah glanced over her shoulder, her eyes locking onto her daughter’s one final time.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Remember who you are, Little Star.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A <strong>plea. A prayer.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Remember our love.”</span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 5: The Moment of No Return</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana pressed herself <strong>against the stone wall, heart pounding.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Through the gaps between the crates, she saw <strong>the guards advance.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>Inquisitor strode forward</strong>, his <strong>bejeweled finger jabbing into Aelius’ chest.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Words were exchanged, but <strong>Arana couldn’t hear them.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then—<strong>her mother was forced to her knees.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius <strong>roared in fury.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Something <strong>shattered.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A <strong>stall of glassware exploded</strong>, sending a <strong>rain of sharp shards clattering onto the cobblestones.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The Inquisitor <strong>smiled.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s blood <strong>ran cold.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He lifted his ring to his lips, <strong>whispering.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A single, <strong>twisting rope of fire</strong> erupted from his palm, spiraling around <strong>her parents’ wrists.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The searing heat made them <strong>scream.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>clamped her hands over her mouth</strong> to stop herself from crying out.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her father <strong>lunged at the Inquisitor</strong>—but was <strong>struck down instantly</strong>, his head <strong>hitting the stones with a sickening thud.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>crowd erupted.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not in protest.<br>Not in horror.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>In cheers.</strong></span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 6: The Last Goodbye</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The flames <strong>dissolved</strong>, but the chains remained.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>guards lifted her parents to their feet.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Their faces were <strong>empty now</strong>, their <strong>dignity an insult to those who jeered the loudest.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s mother <strong>turned her head one last time.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And their <strong>eyes met.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was <strong>only a moment.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But <strong>Arana would remember it forever.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A look of <strong>unbreakable love.</strong><br>A silent promise.<br>A goodbye.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then—<strong>they were gone.</strong></span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 7: The World Without Them</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>did not move.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not when the <strong>crowd dispersed</strong>, returning to their daily business.<br>Not when the <strong>Inquisitor and his guards marched away</strong>, dragging her parents into the abyss.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She waited.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Until <strong>night fell.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Only then, in the <strong>cold silence of an empty street</strong>, did she <strong>crawl from her hiding place.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Something <strong>caught the moonlight</strong>, just a few feet away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A glint of <strong>gold and green.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She crept toward it, <strong>heart hammering.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was the <strong>brooch her parents had bought for her.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Their <strong>last gift.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She picked it up, <strong>clutching it to her chest</strong> as tears <strong>silently spilled down her face.</strong></span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 8: A Lonely House</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The walk home felt <strong>longer than it ever had before.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She pushed open the door, stepping into the <strong>quiet house that no longer felt like home.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>kitchen table was still set for dinner.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>fireplace still smoldered.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was <strong>as if the world had stopped—</strong><br>And <strong>only she remained.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana reached for her mother’s <strong>thick cloak</strong>, still draped over a chair.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She pulled it around herself, <strong>seeking warmth that no longer existed.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wandered into her parents’ bedroom, curled up on their bed, and <strong>wept into the silence.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Until, exhausted, she finally fell into <strong>a restless, uneasy

The evening air is sharp, the wind cutting through the empty streets<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Arana</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The city had <strong>fallen back into its rhythm.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The market stalls had been packed away.<br>The shopkeepers had shuttered their doors.<br>The torches along the streets flickered <strong>like nothing had changed.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But Arana had changed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her feet carried her forward, <strong>one step at a time</strong>, though she did not feel them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The smell of <strong>smoke still clung to her clothes.</strong><br>The phantom of <strong>the flames burned behind her eyes.</strong><br>The echoes of <strong>her parents’ silence rang in her ears.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She walked like a ghost, <strong>unseen, unheard, untouched.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">At the edges of her vision, people <strong>moved in their homes</strong>, gathering for supper, lighting their fires.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They were <strong>laughing. Talking. Living.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her fists clenched.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They had <strong>cheered</strong> while her parents burned.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They had <strong>clapped and smiled</strong> while the fire swallowed them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her throat <strong>closed, her breath catching in small, broken gasps.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wanted to <strong>scream at them, shake them, make them see—</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,

style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The table was still <strong>set for dinner.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Aelius’ chair still <strong>pushed back slightly, as if he had just risen to fetch something.</strong><br>Mirah’s embroidery <strong>half-folded on the side table, waiting for hands that would never finish it.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was like they had just <strong>stepped out</strong> for a moment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:

step inside.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then another.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her <strong>legs shook</strong>, but she moved anyway.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She <strong>reached for her mother’s cloak</strong>, still draped over

Afraid someone would <strong>recognize her and wonder why she was alone.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hadn’t spoken in days.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The only sound was <strong>the fire crackling, the wind pressing against the shutters.</strong></span></p><p><span

style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But <strong>her stomach didn’t care about right or wrong.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She crept into the <strong>marketplace</strong>, keeping to the edges, watching the vendors.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The smell of <strong>fresh bread made her dizzy.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She <strong>couldn’t buy it.</strong> She had <strong>no money, no one to ask.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her hands <strong>curled into fists.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">There was <strong>a boy her age</strong>, pulling at his mother’s skirts, <strong>laughing, full and warm.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She watched as his mother <strong>bought him a honeyed bun, pressing it into his small hands.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The boy <strong>giggled, sticky fingers clinging to the treat.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s <strong>stomach twisted painfully.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She turned away, her eyes landing on a <strong>cart of fruit.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The vendor was <strong>busy, speaking to someone.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>took a step closer.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then another.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The fruit was <strong>right there, within reach.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">One apple.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">That’s all she needed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her heart <strong>hammered as she reached out—</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Snatched it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And <strong>ran.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t stop until she was back at the house, breathless, hands shaking.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She <strong>bit into the apple.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was the <strong>sweetest thing she had ever tasted.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She <strong>didn’t cry.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But something inside her <strong>felt different now.</strong></span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,

New Roman&quot;, serif\">She learned how to <strong>take what she needed.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She <strong>stole carefully, quietly.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A <strong>loaf of bread here, a handful of nuts there.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wasn’t proud of it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she was <strong>still alive.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The house was <strong>cleaner now, the hearth always burning, the rooms swept.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She made sure it <strong>didn’t smell empty anymore.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She kept the <strong>windows shut.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She slept with her <strong>parents’ blankets wrapped around her, even as spring warmed the air.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Every night, she whispered,</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,

She wrapped her arms around herself in a futile attempt to keep warm, pressing her back against the damp wood of a warehouse wall, her body hidden in the long morning shadows. The docks were usually alive with movement by this time of day, with men shouting over the crash of cargo being unloaded, the creak of ropes tightening as the morning’s shipments were hauled onto the piers. But today, an eerie stillness had settled over everything, interrupted only by the soft lap of water against the hulls of ships.</p><p>Winter had come too early, creeping into the city like an uninvited guest, bringing with it hunger, sickness, and a new level of cruelty. The markets had been bare for days, the vendors watching their carts like hawks, their eyes sharp and unforgiving, their hands quick to grab any thief by the collar. Arana had already tried the inns, scavenging behind taverns and bakeries, but with so little food left to spare, even those places had stopped yielding scraps.</p><p>Now, she had no choice but to take a greater risk.</p><p>She had been watching the dock workers for almost an hour, waiting for the right moment. Her stomach was an empty pit, a gnawing, twisting thing that clawed at her insides. She had not eaten since the morning before, and even then, it had only been a few scraps of old bread she had managed to grab from a pile of discarded crusts. If she didn’t eat something today, she knew she wouldn’t have the strength to try again tomorrow.</p><p>Her gaze locked onto a crate that had been left momentarily unattended. A merchant, deep in a heated argument with a ship captain, stood with his back turned, his voice rising above the dull hum of morning activity. The workers nearby were focused on hauling a heavy load off the ship’s deck, their attention elsewhere. Arana took a slow, steady breath. This was her chance.</p><p>She moved swiftly, slipping out from her hiding place and onto the pier with practiced ease. Her small hands darted beneath the edge of a rough burlap sack, her fingers closing around two firm, dirt-covered potatoes. She pulled them free, stuffing them beneath her cloak. Her heart pounded, a steady, frantic rhythm against her ribs. She could do this. She just had to be fast.</p><p>Then, her gaze flickered to a barrel sitting just a few feet away. A fish, fresh and glistening with moisture, hung over the edge, its silver scales catching the morning light. She hesitated for only a moment before reaching for it.</p><p>As soon as her fingers grasped the slippery flesh, her foot caught on something solid—a coiled rope, thick and stiff with moisture. Before she could catch herself, she stumbled forward, crashing onto the wooden planks with a sharp, painful jolt. The fish slid from her grasp, slapping against the dock with a wet, damning sound.</p><p>For a moment, there was silence.</p><p>Then, a furious voice rang out.</p><p>“THIEF!”</p><p>A rough hand clamped down on her arm before she could scramble away, yanking her upward with such force that she felt her shoulder protest in pain.</p><p>She struggled, kicking out, twisting in the man’s grasp, but the dock guard was far stronger than she was. His grip tightened, his fingers bruising her thin wrist as he held her fast.</p><p>“Thought you could just take what you pleased and slip away like a rat?” he sneered, shaking her roughly. “Not today.”</p><p>Arana gritted her teeth and kicked at him again, but he barely reacted, merely shifting his weight so her blows were useless. The fight was meaningless; she had no strength left to give.</p><p>With an ease that made her feel all the more powerless, the guard swung her over his shoulder, gripping her ankles with one massive hand to keep her from squirming free. The world tilted violently as he carried her through the streets, his heavy boots pounding against the cobblestones. She twisted, pounded her fists against his back, but he hardly seemed to notice.</p><p>People turned to look as they passed, some murmuring in recognition, others smirking in approval. She saw a woman shake her head in disapproval, a merchant mutter something under his breath, but no one stepped in. No one cared.</p><p>By the time the guard reached the church, her struggles had grown weaker, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The heavy oak doors loomed before her, their surface worn smooth by time and reverence.</p><p>She had seen people taken here before.</p><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 2: Judgment at the Church</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> A rundown church near the docks<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Mid-morning, the frost still thick on the steps<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Arana</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The inside of the church was dim, the heavy wooden doors muffling the noise of the city beyond. The air was thick with the scent of incense, cloying and suffocating, as if it were trying to mask something rotten underneath. The high stone walls bore carvings of divine scripture, lines of praise to the gods of light, but the flickering candlelight cast strange shadows over the lettering, twisting the words into something unreadable.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana was shoved forward, her small body stumbling under the force of the guard’s grip. The impact sent a sharp jolt through her already aching limbs, but she forced herself upright, clenching her fists at her sides. She wouldn’t let them see her wince. She wouldn’t give them that satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A row of priests sat at a long wooden table at the front of the chamber, their robes pristine despite the damp chill of the room. They looked almost identical—thin, pale men with hollow cheeks and sharp, assessing gazes. Each one bore the same vacant expression, a blend of boredom and self-importance, as if the duty of passing judgment on people like her was a tiresome inconvenience rather than a sacred calling.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">One of them, a man with iron-gray hair and a face lined with age, folded his hands over the table and looked at the guard. “Crime?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Thievery at the docks,” the man responded, his grip still tight on Arana’s wrist. “Caught her stealing from merchant crates before sunrise.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The priest turned his gaze to her. His eyes were a washed-out blue, void of warmth, void of pity. He studied her for a long moment, taking in the state of her thin frame, her dirt-smudged face, the ragged cloak wrapped tightly around her small shoulders.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana lifted her chin, refusing to cower beneath his scrutiny.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The priest exhaled through his nose, the sound sharp and dismissive. “Theft is a serious crime,” he said, though his voice was devoid of any real emotion. “For those who do not respect the property of others, there must be consequences.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Another priest leaned forward, his hands steepled together. “She’s young,” he mused, glancing at his fellow council members. “She might be better suited for penitence work in the kitchens.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s stomach twisted. The church kitchens meant <strong>scrubbing floors, carrying heavy sacks of grain, washing dishes until her fingers bled</strong>—it meant being <strong>trapped</strong> inside these walls, serving the very people who had taken everything from her. She felt the sting of humiliation rise in her throat, but she swallowed it down, biting the inside of her cheek so hard she tasted blood.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The iron-haired priest, the one who had spoken first, shook his head. “No. A night in the stocks will serve her better.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The decision was made with such casual finality that it left no room for debate.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana felt her body go rigid, but she refused to react. The guard gave a satisfied grunt, his grip tightening as he hauled her back toward the entrance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The church doors creaked open, flooding the dim chamber with pale, icy light. The cold air hit her like a slap, but it wasn’t enough to drive away the weight settling in her stomach.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had seen <strong>plenty of thieves in the stocks before.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had <strong>watched them sit there for hours</strong>, their wrists and necks locked in place, their bodies stiff from the cold as the city passed judgment on them in the cruelest way possible.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Now, it was her turn.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And <strong>she would have to endure it alone.</strong></span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 3: The Stocks</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> Market square near the docks<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Noon, the sun offering no warmth<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Early Winter, Jart Month<br><strong>Weather:</strong> Bitterly cold, wind sharp and dry<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Arana<br><strong>Time Passed Since Previous Scene:</strong> One hour</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The stocks stood in the center of the market square, their wood aged and cracked from years of exposure to the elements. The thick beams, darkened by old stains, bore the evidence of <strong>countless punishments before hers.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The guards wasted no time. One yanked open the heavy wooden frame, its hinges groaning in protest, while another shoved Arana forward. She stumbled but caught herself before she could fall, her hands gripping the rough surface of the stocks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Put your hands in,” one of the men ordered, his voice flat.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hesitated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A sharp <strong>crack</strong> of a cane against the wood near her ear made her flinch. “Now.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Gritting her teeth, she forced her hands into the openings, her neck following a moment later. The wood slammed shut around her, pressing against her skin, restricting her movement entirely. The iron latch locked into place with a decisive <strong>clank</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She was trapped.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">At first, <strong>nothing happened.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The market continued around her, people moving in and out of stalls, their voices blending into a dull hum of conversation. A horse clattered by, its hooves striking against the cobblestones. Somewhere, a merchant called out a price for fresh apples.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">For a fleeting moment, it seemed as though no one cared.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then the first person stopped.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Look at this,” a woman murmured, pausing a few paces away. “Just a child.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“A thief,” another corrected. “Should’ve had her hands taken instead.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>forced herself to remain still.</strong> She refused to meet their gazes, refused to acknowledge them at all.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But more people gathered.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It started with <strong>the words.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Little rat.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Filthy urchin.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Probably a bastard from some heretic’s bed.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then came <strong>the laughter.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not loud, not raucous—just soft, sneering chuckles.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then came <strong>the first piece of fruit.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It hit her shoulder, bursting on impact. The sour, rotting pulp slid down the side of her cloak, its stench filling her nose.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She gritted her teeth.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then another came. Then another.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Someone threw a small stone, striking her <strong>just beneath her eye.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Let’s see how she likes going hungry now,” a man sneered, lobbing a half-eaten loaf of moldy bread in her direction.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The world around her <strong>blurred into a haze of jeering voices and dull impacts.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her stomach <strong>ached with hunger, but she would not eat from the filth they threw at her.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Time <strong>stretched endlessly.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The sun crawled across the sky, slow and indifferent.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She tried shifting her weight, but the wood dug into her wrists, <strong>the sharp edges rubbing her skin raw.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her neck stiffened from holding the same position, but she could do nothing to ease the strain.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The cold settled into her bones.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The insults <strong>continued</strong> but became white noise, blending into one endless hum of derision.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana did not cry.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She would <strong>not</strong> cry.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She clenched her jaw so tightly it ached, her nails digging into her palms, her breath slow and steady.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had <strong>nothing left</strong> but her own defiance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She would not beg.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She would not give them the satisfaction.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Night came, but <strong>the cruelty did not end.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A drunken man stumbled out of a tavern, spotting her as he passed. He let out a wheezing laugh before <strong>tossing the remains of his beer in her face.</strong> The bitter liquid seeped into her clothes, soaking her already chilled skin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A pair of young lovers, passing on their moonlit stroll, <strong>paused long enough to whisper something cruel before spitting at her feet.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">By the time the last of them had gone, when the square had fallen quiet, when the city had finally <strong>turned its gaze away</strong>, she felt <strong>nothing at all.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A guard approached near dawn, unlocking the latch with a careless flick of his wrist.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The wooden beam <strong>lifted away</strong>, but Arana did not move.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her body was stiff, <strong>her limbs unresponsive.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The guard gave a <strong>sharp kick to the back of her legs,</strong> knocking her forward. She <strong>collapsed onto the ground, landing hard on her hands and knees.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She barely felt it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Try it again,” the guard said, voice casual, almost bored. “And next time, you’ll get the whip instead.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He turned away without waiting for a response.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana did not move <strong>for a long time.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her body <strong>ached.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her head was <strong>light, empty.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Eventually, she <strong>forced herself upright.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She took a step.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then another.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then another.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then she walked away.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana is publicly humiliated and punished in the stocks, exposing her to the full cruelty of the city.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She experiences firsthand the <strong>indifference and mockery</strong> of the people she once thought of as distant figures in the marketplace.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This moment <strong>shatters</strong> her belief that she can simply endure and survive on her own.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The punishment <strong>breaks something inside her,</strong> forcing her to reconsider her path.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She realizes that <strong>pride alone will not keep her alive.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visual</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A <strong>small, thin figure walking alone through the dark streets, her head bowed, her steps slow.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The city around her is <strong>silent, uncaring, indifferent.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A church bell <strong>tolls in the distance, low and haunting, as if mocking her.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>She knows what she has to do next.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Questions for Refinement</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Would you like a moment where <strong>a familiar face sees her in the stocks but turns away in fear?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Should there be <strong>a moment of near-breaking, where she almost begs for mercy but swallows it down?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Would you like a <strong>brief internal memory of her father telling her never to kneel before the church, making her final decision all the more bitter?</strong></span></p></li></ol>",

She had <strong>refused</strong> to consider it, had tried to convince herself that she could find another way, that she could <strong>survive</strong> without lowering herself to this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But in the morning, when she had stood up and found herself <strong>too weak to even walk straight</strong>, she had known the truth.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>She had no choice.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The Church loomed ahead, its towering stone walls stark against the winter sky. The streets were quiet, the world muffled beneath the pressing weight of the cold. She could hear <strong>her own breath</strong>, could feel the thudding of her heart against her ribs as she walked toward the entrance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her steps felt heavier with each one she took.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had <strong>cursed the Church</strong> every day since they took her parents. <strong>She had sworn she would never set foot in one of their sanctuaries.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And yet, here she was.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She reached the base of the steps and hesitated, her fingers curling into fists at her sides.

A few figures sat scattered among the pews, their heads bowed, their hands clasped. The faint rustling of robes could be heard as a priest moved near the altar, carefully arranging papers on a wooden lectern.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana kept her steps light as she walked toward him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her throat was dry.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The moment she <strong>spoke</strong>, it would be real.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wanted to turn and run.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Before she could, the priest looked up. He was older than she had expected, his hair mostly gray, his round spectacles perched low on the bridge of his nose. His robes were simple, a stark contrast to the extravagant attire worn by the High Inquisitors she had seen patrolling the city. His face was <strong>lined with age</strong>, but his eyes were warm, his expression one of quiet patience.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Can I help you, child?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His voice was gentle.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>hated him for it.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She forced herself to <strong>speak</strong>, her voice barely above a whisper.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I… I need some food.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The words <strong>felt like knives in her throat.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The priest studied her for a moment, then <strong>sighed softly, shaking his head.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“By Thalaa, you’re thin.” His voice carried no judgment, only simple observation. “Come.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He turned and began walking toward a side door, expecting her to follow.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>didn’t move.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had expected questions.

Maps lay unfurled, documents covered in fine, slanting script scattered between them. His ink-stained fingers tapped absently on the wooden surface, though his sharp gaze remained fixed on the words before him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric knew better than to interrupt his father when he was working, <strong>but the silence made him fidget.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He didn’t mind lessons—not always. <strong>But he liked the ones where his father told him stories of old kings and great battles, of heroes and their victories.</strong> Not the ones where he sat still and tried to understand words that blurred together on parchment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">After what felt like forever, the king exhaled and finally set the papers aside. His expression softened slightly when he looked at Edric.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Do you know what this is?” Alistair asked, sliding one of the documents toward him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric hesitated before shaking his head.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“A report from the Church of Divine Light,” his father explained, leaning back in his chair. “The Order of Flame sends me these every month.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric straightened slightly. “Because they serve you?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair’s lips curved in something close to amusement. “Because they serve Veridian.” His fingers tapped against the parchment. “They ensure the kingdom’s order. They ensure safety.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric frowned a little, <strong>trying to piece together what that meant.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father’s expression grew more serious. “Do you know why safety is important, Edric?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“So no one gets hurt?” the boy guessed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The smile faded. Alistair studied him for a long moment before saying, <strong>“So <em>you</em> don’t get hurt.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric blinked. <strong>He hadn’t expected that.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father’s tone wasn’t unkind, but there was something heavy in it. A weight Edric didn’t quite understand.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“The kingdom is strong,” Alistair continued, picking up the report again. “But strength alone isn’t enough. A single weak point, a single crack in the foundation, and the whole thing crumbles.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric frowned. <strong>He didn’t like the idea of things crumbling.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“But…” He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. “If it’s strong, why does it need protecting?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father didn’t answer right away. Instead, he studied him, <strong>his sharp gaze thoughtful, measuring.</strong> Then, slowly, he reached across the table and set the report in front of Edric.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Read that,” he said, tapping a finger against a line of text.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric shifted forward, his small hands pressing against the edge of the table. <strong>He could read a little, but the words were stiff and unfamiliar.</strong> Slowly, he sounded them out in his head.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">One phrase stood out.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>Executed for heresy.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His stomach tightened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“…What’s heresy?” he asked hesitantly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair leaned back, his fingers steepling together. “It means defying the will of the gods,” he said simply. “It means believing in something dangerous. Something that could harm the kingdom.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric shifted in his seat. <strong>He didn’t like that answer.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“But...” He hesitated again, his small fingers curling against his lap. “Why do they have to die?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father’s expression didn’t change. “Because they would let the world burn, if given the chance.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric’s throat felt dry. <strong>His mind scrambled for something to hold onto, something that made sense.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He thought of the birds in the garden, the way they flitted down to him, unafraid. <strong>He thought of the way his mother had smiled in the paintings he had seen of her.</strong> He thought of his father now, so certain, so firm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">For the first time, he wasn’t sure which version of the world was true.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair must have noticed his silence, because the king sighed. His sharp expression softened, just a little.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I don’t expect you to understand this yet,” he said, his tone quieter. “And I don’t want you to carry this weight before you must. But one day, Edric, you <em>will</em> have to understand. Because this—” he gestured to the papers, the maps, the entire weight of the kingdom spread before them, “<em>—this will all be yours.</em>”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric swallowed, his small fingers curling slightly against the edge of the chair.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">One day.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">One day had always felt so far away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But in his father’s voice, <strong>it did not sound far at all.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Refinement Questions:</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Does the balance feel right between fatherly warmth and the weight of responsibility?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Should Alistair be more reassuring at the end, or is it better to let Edric sit with that weight?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Would you like more of Edric’s emotions explored, or does the scene convey enough through his reactions?</strong></span></p></li></ol><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 2: The Queen’s Garden</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> The Royal Palace Gardens, Sheen<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Afternoon, after his lesson<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Early Winter, Jart Month<br><strong>Weather:</strong> Cold, light snowfall continuing<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Edric (Age 6)</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric liked the garden best when it was empty.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Here, among the frost-covered hedges and the skeletal branches of the trees, the palace felt far away. There were no stiff-backed tutors, no endless etiquette lessons, no courtiers whispering behind their sleeves. Just the crunch of snow beneath his boots and the stillness of the winter air.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And, of course, <strong>her.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He had barely settled beneath his favorite tree—an old pine with broad, outstretched branches that shielded him from the falling snow—before he heard the familiar soft patter of paws on frozen ground.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He didn’t even have to look up. He smiled.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Hello, Mari,” he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The cat emerged from behind the kennels, slinking around the stone corner like she had been there all along. <strong>The dogs within barked furiously at her passing, but she didn’t so much as flinch.</strong> She never did. They were beneath her notice.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She was <strong>beautiful.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her fur was sleek black, except for the small patch of white on her chest. Her green eyes were bright and knowing, too intelligent for a simple stray. Edric had no idea where she came from. She was not one of the palace cats, nor had any of the stable hands claimed her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she always appeared the moment he entered the gardens.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And no matter how many times he had tried to follow her—to see where she went, to bring her scraps of meat or a bowl of milk—she always managed to <strong>vanish</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She belonged to no one.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Except, perhaps, to him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mari stretched languidly before trotting toward him, pushing her head against his snow-dusted boots before <strong>climbing up his legs with casual ease.</strong> By the time she curled into his lap, a warm weight against the cold, it was as if she had <strong>claimed him</strong>, rather than the other way around.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric ran his gloved hand gently over her back. She purred immediately.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He leaned back against the tree, letting the sound settle in his chest, warm and steady.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I missed you,” he murmured.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He wasn’t sure when he had started <strong>talking to her like this.</strong> Like she was someone who could understand. Someone who listened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Like she was his <strong>mother.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was a silly thing. He knew that.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But sometimes, when he sat here alone, when the snow fell softly around him, he could almost <strong>pretend</strong>.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Pretend that his mother’s spirit had come back to him, slipping into this sleek little cat, watching over him, keeping him safe.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She never spoke, of course.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But in his mind, she did.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">In his mind, he imagined her voice—soft, warm, laughing as she curled around him and flicked her tail beneath his chin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>You are not alone, my love.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He swallowed hard.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He hated that he didn’t even remember her voice.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He scratched Mari behind her ears, watching the way she pressed into his touch. “You wouldn’t leave me, would you?” he whispered.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She only purred.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He didn’t know how long he sat there, the world fading to just the warmth of her body against his, the quiet breath of the trees. But then—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The peace shattered.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A shadow moved at the garden’s edge.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mari’s head shot up. Her body went rigid in his lap. Her fur bristled, a low hiss curling from her throat.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric turned sharply, his pulse spiking.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick stood at the edge of the path, his dark robes blending with the stone behind him, <strong>watching.</strong> He had been there for some time, Edric realized. He wasn’t sure how long.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Your Highness,” Varick said smoothly, stepping forward.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mari let out another sharp hiss, her ears flattening. <strong>Then, in a blur of movement, she twisted from Edric’s lap and fled.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric clenched his jaw, his little fists balling at his sides. “You scared her,” he snapped.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“My sincerest apologies,” Varick said, inclining his head. But his voice held no real sincerity. <strong>His lips curled just slightly, like he was amused.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric’s anger flared hotter.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He was the Prince. Varick should <strong>not</strong> be amused.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He pushed himself to his feet, brushing the snow from his cloak. “You didn’t have to come,” he said, crossing his arms.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Your father sent me,” Varick replied, unbothered. “He expects you in his study.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric hesitated, glancing back toward the hedgerow where Mari had disappeared. He wished she would come back. But she never did when others were around.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His hands clenched.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He turned back to Varick. “I don’t like you,” he said bluntly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick chuckled softly at that. “That is a very strong opinion for a boy so young.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I’m not a boy,” Edric shot back, his small face serious. “I’m the Prince.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Indeed you are,” Varick agreed, still entirely unaffected. “And the King is waiting for you.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric scowled but <strong>turned toward the palace.</strong> He didn’t want to go. But he would.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Before stepping away, he stole one last glance at the hedgerow.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Mari was gone.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Mari is established as a presence in Edric’s life.</strong> She is more than a pet—she is his comfort, his silent companion, the only thing that truly feels like his.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Edric’s belief that his mother’s spirit might be in the cat shows his deep loneliness.</strong> It also gives insight into his imagination and quiet longing for a connection to something greater.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Varick’s presence disrupts the moment, highlighting his role as a looming figure in Edric’s life.</strong> He is always watching.

The trees <strong>spoke</strong>. The rivers <strong>sang</strong>.

A big, golden one in the sky, and the trees talked, and the rivers sang, and—”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Brenna clicked her tongue as she pulled the blankets off him, <strong>amused but not encouraging.</strong> “Sounds like quite the dream, Your Highness. Now, arms up.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>complied automatically</strong>, lifting his arms as she slipped the soft linen undershirt over his head before helping him into the rich blue tunic his father preferred. He barely noticed—he was too busy <strong>bouncing on his feet, still brimming with excitement.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“And Mari talked! She actually talked, Brenna! She told me all sorts of things, and her voice was warm and soft like—like mother’s must have been!”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">For just a moment, Brenna’s hands <strong>paused</strong> at the mention of the late queen. It was so brief Edric barely noticed before she continued, lacing the ties of his tunic.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“A clever cat,” she said, her voice steady. “But even a prince’s dreams can’t make her talk, my dear.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>frowned at that</strong>, crossing his arms. “But what if they could?” He <strong>turned on his heel</strong>, bouncing to keep up with her as she led him toward the door. “What if I really could do it? What if I had <strong>magic</strong>?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Brenna <strong>stopped.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was only for a second, but Edric <strong>felt</strong> it. The air in the room changed—just a little, just enough.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then she was moving again, pressing open the heavy wooden door as if she hadn’t heard him at all.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric huffed, but <strong>followed her out.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 4: The Weight of a King’s Words</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> King Alistair’s Private Study, Royal Palace, Sheen<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Morning, the fire crackling softly in the hearth<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Early Winter, Jart Month<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> King Alistair</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The door to the study <strong>burst open</strong>, and before Alistair even looked up from his documents, his son’s voice filled the room.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“And then I’d make Mari talk!

No, no—a floating <strong>city</strong>! And all the poor people could live there so they’d never be cold or hungry again, and—and maybe I could even make the rain golden instead of wet, and—”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Brenna,” Alistair said, his voice level.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She inclined her head, hesitating just a breath before leaving the study.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The door <strong>clicked shut.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">For a moment, <strong>all was silent.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric finally <strong>looked at his father.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His little hands were still animated, his cheeks pink from excitement, but something in the way his father sat <strong>so still</strong> made him hesitate.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Father?” he asked, tilting his head.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair exhaled slowly, steepling his fingers. “Come here, Edric.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric approached, still <strong>buzzing</strong> with energy, though he moved a little slower now. He scrambled into the chair across from his father, his small legs swinging slightly above the floor.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair studied him <strong>carefully.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The boy’s <strong>innocence was both a gift and a curse.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You seem quite taken with this idea of magic,” Alistair said finally.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>nodded eagerly</strong>. “Yes! If I had magic, I could make everything better! I could—”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair <strong>held up a hand.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>stopped.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Do you know what magic truly is, Edric?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric frowned, thinking for a moment. “It’s...power.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair’s gaze did not waver. “Power to do what?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric opened his mouth, then hesitated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father’s voice remained <strong>calm, steady.</strong> “Magic does not build floating castles. It does not bring endless summer or make animals speak.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>blinked.</strong> “But the gods—”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair’s jaw tightened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>sat up straighter</strong>, his excitement returning despite his father’s serious expression. “The gods have magic! They make it rain when the priests ask them to! You told me that, remember?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair inhaled deeply through his nose. He should not have to explain this—this was a lesson for tutors, not something to be unraveled in a morning’s idle conversation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But <strong>here they were.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He folded his hands in front of him. “There are two kinds of magic, Edric. The kind that serves the gods and the kind that serves itself.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric frowned, his brows furrowing. “But if magic is bad, then… why do the priests have it?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair tapped his fingers against the wooden desk. “Because <strong>they do not take it.</strong> They are given it, by the gods themselves. <strong>That</strong> is Divine Magic. It is a gift, granted to those who serve, those who heal, those who protect the kingdom.” He met Edric’s wide eyes. “But there is another kind of magic. The <strong>Wild Magic.</strong> The kind that corrupts. The kind that tempts men to steal power for themselves.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric’s face <strong>fell slightly.</strong> “Oh…”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair’s voice remained even. “That magic is not a gift, Edric. It is a <strong>curse.</strong>”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric’s hands gripped the armrests of his chair, his feet no longer swinging.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“But…” his voice was quieter now, <strong>uncertain.</strong> “But the people at the church—when we go to morning Auro, I see them pray for things. For food, for healing, for warmth in the winter. They pray for magic, don’t they?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair exhaled sharply, his patience thinning.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“It is not the same.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>shrunk slightly.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair softened his tone, but only slightly. “Divine Magic comes only to those the gods deem worthy. It is given. Wild Magic is taken. <strong>That is why it is dangerous.</strong> That is why those who wield it must be stopped.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric swallowed hard.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“They use magic to deceive,” Alistair continued. “To kill. To hurt people.” He leaned forward slightly. “Do you understand?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>nodded slowly,</strong> though his hands fidgeted in his lap.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He was <strong>silent</strong> for a long moment, staring at the wood grain of the desk.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair watched him, waiting.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Finally, Edric spoke. His voice was <strong>small.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“But what if they don’t mean to hurt people?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair’s fingers curled slightly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">That… was the worst question his son could have asked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Because once upon a time, <strong>he had asked it, too.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And the answer had cost him <strong>everything.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair sat back in his chair, exhaling slowly. “It doesn’t matter,” he said finally.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric looked up, startled.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father’s eyes were <strong>hard now.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Magic does not care for intentions, Edric,” Alistair said. “It corrupts. It consumes.” He held his son’s gaze, firm but not unkind. “And in the end, it destroys.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The study fell <strong>quiet.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric sat <strong>very still.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair could see the way his son <strong>tried to fit those words into his small, childish world.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He hoped he would not have to repeat them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He hoped they would <strong>stick.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Edric expresses childish excitement about magic, unaware of its danger.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Alistair firmly establishes the division between Divine and Wild Magic.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Edric is left unsettled, his innocent dreams crushed under the weight of his father’s explanation.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The first cracks in Edric’s understanding of the world begin to form.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visual:</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Edric sits smaller in his chair, the excitement drained from his face.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Alistair’s expression is unreadable, but his hands are tight against the desk.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The fire crackles softly, its light flickering across the cold stone walls.</strong></span></p></li></ul>",

Stalls brimmed with fabrics and trinkets, each vendor shouting over the next to hawk their wares. Arana crouched beside a rough wooden crate that served as her stall, brushing dust off her meager display—a handful of carved wooden figures, a few etched pendants, and two small paintings.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It wasn’t much.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had found scraps of decent wood and bartered for cheap paints with an old seamstress in exchange for carrying water to her shop. The paints were mostly dull, but she had worked carefully, layering color where she could. The little birds she carved had smooth, curved wings, and if she looked at them just right, she could almost hear her father’s voice—<em>Use the grain, Arana. Let the wood tell you what it wants to be.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A group of passing merchants barely glanced at her. One man, wealthy enough to be idly sucking on a piece of candied orange, gave her carvings a brief look before moving on without a word.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana forced herself not to fidget. She had seen other street kids selling things—trinkets, broken watches, scavenged jewelry. But their wares were things people needed or could trick themselves into believing were valuable. <em>Food, metal, cloth.</em> She had seen one boy sell a pocket watch with no hands for three copper pennies.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But <strong>art?</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">People in Sovalis didn’t waste coin on sentiment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She was about to call it a loss when a small hand reached for one of the birds. A little girl, no older than five, ran her fingers along the carved wings, tilting it back and forth as if she could make it fly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s breath hitched.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I want this one, Mama,” the girl said, clutching the bird tightly to her chest.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The woman standing behind her hesitated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana knew that hesitation. It meant a quick shake of the head, an apologetic smile, and then footsteps walking away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She braced herself for it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Instead, the woman sighed. “Alright, sweet one.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana barely kept her face neutral as the woman reached into her purse. She expected a few copper pennies, maybe—if she was truly lucky—a whole shilling.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Instead, the woman pressed two <strong>silver shillings</strong> into her palm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her fingers clenched around the coins instinctively.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This was too much. More than she made in weeks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her stomach twisted.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The woman hesitated, glancing around the market as if debating whether to say something more. Then, softly, she tucked an extra copper penny into Arana’s palm and <strong>closed her fingers around it.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The touch startled her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“A child shouldn’t be alone in a place like this,” the woman murmured, her voice meant for Arana alone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then she took her daughter’s hand and disappeared into the crowd.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana sat frozen, staring at the weight of silver in her palm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">For a moment—just a moment—a spark of something unfamiliar flickered in her chest. <strong>Hope.</strong> Two silver shillings could mean food for weeks. Could mean a real bed for a night.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Could mean something more.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But <strong>then the fear set in.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This was dangerous.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The market had its own rules, and everyone played by them. Street kids who had too much were street kids who got noticed. And getting noticed got you <strong>hurt.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She needed to leave. Now.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She shoved the coins deep into her pocket, glancing around as casually as she could manage.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">That was when she saw him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A boy, maybe a year older than her, lounging against a stall. He was big, strong, his messy brown hair too wild for someone who spent his time in the filth of the streets. His arms were crossed, but his sharp green eyes had followed the <strong>entire exchange.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then, he grinned.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Slow and knowing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, as if nothing had happened, <strong>he looked away.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana swallowed hard.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wasn’t the only one who had seen.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And that meant trouble.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">• <strong>Arana has found a small way to earn money beyond stealing,</strong> but it’s unstable and unpredictable.<br>• The <strong>silver shillings mark her as a target</strong> in the eyes of other street kids.<br>• The <strong>first act of kindness in a long time unsettles her.</strong> It is rare.

She gasped, her feet stumbling over loose stones as her back slammed into the rough brick wall.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She knew them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not their names, but their faces. They were the kind that prowled the market’s edge, never buying, never begging. Only taking.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You got lucky today, didn’t you?” The tallest of them, a boy with greasy hair and a broken tooth, leered down at her. His breath reeked of old meat and something sour.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana didn’t answer.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had survived too long to be stupid.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Give it over,” the second boy, wiry and sharp-faced, stepped closer.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her stomach clenched. She had made mistakes before—small ones. Letting her guard down at the wrong moment, slipping into the wrong streets, misjudging how much food she could take without being noticed. But this was different. This was <em>big.</em> This wasn’t a loaf of stolen bread or a pocket snatched too clumsily.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This was two <em>whole</em> silver shillings.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The third one, the burly girl with a nasty scar across her cheek, cracked her knuckles. “Come on, rat,” she sneered. “Make it easy on yourself.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s pulse hammered. She knew how this would go. If she handed the money over, they wouldn’t just leave her be. They’d humiliate her, maybe hit her a few times for fun.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">If she fought, it would be worse.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Still, she hesitated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A mistake.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The thin boy lunged for her pocket. Arana twisted, slamming her foot down on his shin. Hard.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He yelped, but his grip tightened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She barely had time to brace before the tallest one threw his fist.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Pain exploded in her ribs. The world tilted.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She gasped as she hit the ground, the impact rattling through her bones. Her fingers clawed at the dirt, trying to scramble up, but her chest burned where she’d been hit.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The shadow fell over her again. The boy grinned, raising his fist for another hit—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">—and then he was gone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Something slammed into him, knocking him sideways into the wall.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana blinked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A boy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She barely had time to register the blur of movement before another punch landed—this time on the thin one, sending him sprawling back with blood speckling his lips.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The third kid—the burly girl—was already moving, fists raised, when the boy turned toward her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Steel glinted in the weak light.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A knife. Small, but held with the confidence of someone who knew exactly how to use it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The girl froze.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had seen him before. Around the market, always on the edge of things, always watching but never involved. But now, here he was.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Not this one,” Liam said flatly. His grip on the knife was steady, but his eyes flicked toward the other boy, the one still bleeding from his lip.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The injured boy wiped his mouth with the back of his sleeve, eyes darting between Liam and the knife.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Jeez,” he spat onto the cobblestones. “A’right, Liam. Didn’t know.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He grabbed his bleeding friend by the arm and dragged him away. The girl hesitated a moment longer, then followed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And just like that, it was over.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana sat up slowly, her ribs aching. Her fingers brushed the bruises already blooming beneath her tunic. Her breath came in short, shallow bursts, but she forced herself still.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam wiped his knife on his sleeve and glanced down at her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You could’ve let me handle it,” she muttered, her pride stinging worse than her ribs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam just shrugged. “Could’ve let you get your ass kicked,” he said, voice easy, almost amused. “Didn’t feel like it today.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then he turned and walked off.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana watched him disappear around the corner, her mind racing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t understand. He had <em>nothing</em> to gain from this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, out of the corner of her eye—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A shadow.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not Liam. Not the boys.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A figure standing just at the alley’s entrance, half-hidden in the afternoon light. A man.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A scarf covered the lower half of his face, but she could see the sharp gleam of his eyes beneath the frayed edges. He stood like someone who had been there <em>the whole time.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Watching.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her stomach twisted.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hadn’t noticed him before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">How long had he been there?</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">• <strong>Liam intervenes, but not out of kindness.</strong> His skills and confidence show he’s not just another street rat—he knows how to fight.<br>• <strong>The phrase “She belongs to Grizz” is spoken for the first time.</strong> It carries weight, but Arana doesn’t know why.<br>• <strong>Grizz was there.</strong> But she didn’t see him at first.

She had learned to blend into the movement of the streets, to predict who would stop suddenly, who wouldn’t notice a missing coin, who carried their wealth too loose, too careless.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had learned to take without thinking.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And today, she was proud of herself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The market was bustling, thick with the scent of baked bread and the low murmur of traders hawking their wares. Arana moved through the shifting bodies like she was part of the wind, unseen, unnoticed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had chosen her target well. A fruit vendor, distracted by a wealthy woman haggling over the price of imported grapes. Arana walked past, adjusting her speed, her fingers brushing against a wooden crate, feeling for the right weight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A flick of her wrist, a light shift of balance, and—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The apple vanished into her sleeve.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She slipped away without a sound, her heart steady, the rush now familiar instead of terrifying. It was cleaner than any lift she had pulled before, smoother.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She was getting better.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana ducked into a shadowed gap between two stalls, letting the world pass by without notice. The stolen apple was still warm from the sun as she lifted it to her lips, biting into the crisp skin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>“You’ve gotten good at that.”</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her body reacted before her mind did.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She whirled, her muscles coiled tight, her free hand lifting defensively.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A boy stood just beyond the shadow’s reach, arms crossed over his chest, leaning against the edge of a wooden cart.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s pulse kicked against her ribs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He was watching her again.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hadn’t seen him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She—who had spent a year on these streets, who could <em>feel</em> the weight of a gaze before it landed on her—had not seen <em>him.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">That was worse than being caught.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t move, didn’t speak, only glared at him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam’s smirk was slow and easy, like he wasn’t in a hurry for whatever was about to happen.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Instead of stepping closer, he lifted something into view—another apple.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana tensed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The apple wasn’t whole.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A knife was stabbed straight into its core, its thin blade gleaming as he turned it slightly, as if testing how the light caught on the steel.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her breath hitched.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hadn’t seen him draw it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>How long had he been standing there?</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam flicked his wrist, sending the apple arcing toward her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Instinct took over. She caught it mid-air, but the unexpected weight of the knife nearly pulled it from her grip. She fumbled slightly, adjusting as she curled her fingers around the hilt, her thumb brushing against the smooth, well-worn handle.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had never held a knife before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not like this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not a <em>weapon.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A chill slithered through her, even under the warm afternoon sun.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam tilted his head, watching her reaction.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Go on,” he said lazily. “Eat it.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s fingers tightened around the knife’s handle.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t trust this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t trust <em>him.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Nothing came without a price.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>More Detail: Expanding the Tension</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She carefully pulled the knife free from the apple, wiping its sticky juice against her tunic before sliding it into her palm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It felt foreign. Too solid, too heavy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It wasn’t large—not a long blade, not like the butcher’s knives she had seen in the market. But it was sharp, and she could tell, just by the balance of it in her fingers, that it had been used before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam watched her, waiting.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wanted to throw the knife back. Demand why he had given it to her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But that would mean showing weakness.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Instead, she raised the apple to her lips and took a slow, deliberate bite.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">If he was testing her, she would <em>win.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam smirked, like she had just done something amusing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Guess you’re not as skittish as you look,” he mused.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She swallowed. “Guess you’re not as smart as you think.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His grin widened, but he didn’t argue.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Instead, he pushed off the cart and turned, strolling away as if this had just been a casual conversation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He made it three steps before she called after him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Why?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam paused. He glanced back over his shoulder.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She lifted the knife slightly—not in threat, but in question.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His smirk didn’t falter. “Seemed like you needed one.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, just before he vanished into the crowd, he called back—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>“See you around.”</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her fingers clenched around the knife’s handle.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">That was bad.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Really bad.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had spent a year making herself <em>unseen</em>, unimportant.

The market was thinning, the vendors closing their stalls, the last buyers haggling under dim lantern light.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana was working her way through the streets, her hands warmed by the weight of a few stolen coins, her movements relaxed in the comfort of knowing she’d eat tonight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t see the danger coming.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not until it was too late.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A hand clamped around her wrist, hard and sudden.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She jerked back instinctively, but another hand caught the back of her tunic, twisting the fabric tight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Two of them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not street kids.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grown men.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Little pickpocket,” one of them murmured, his breath reeking of ale. “Thought I saw your sticky fingers earlier.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana twisted sharply, but the grip on her wrist didn’t loosen.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her heart pounded.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The market was still full of people. But nobody was <em>looking.</em> Nobody was <em>watching.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">No one except <em>him.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She saw him now. Just past the edge of the crowd. Standing there, arms crossed, expression unreadable.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The man who had been following her for weeks.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And he did nothing.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Moment of Decision</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s breath came sharp and ragged.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">No one was coming to help her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not the man in the scarf.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not Liam.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not anyone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The first man pulled her closer, his grip bruising. “What do you think, Fenn? We take back what she stole? Or teach her a better lesson?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The second one grinned. “I say both.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana didn’t hesitate.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her hand darted down, fingers closing around the hilt of the knife she had barely used. The one Liam had given her. The one she <em>hadn’t</em> wanted to need.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She drove it into the first man’s forearm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The reaction was instant. A howl of pain, a violent curse, a wild, reflexive shove—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana hit the cobblestones hard, but she was free.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She scrambled back as the man staggered, clutching his arm, blood spilling between his fingers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She expected him to lunge. To grab her again.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But his friend grabbed his shoulder instead, pulling him away. “Not worth it,” Fenn muttered, shooting her a glare before dragging the injured man into the shadows.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Just like that, it was over.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana sat there, chest heaving, the knife still clutched in her fingers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had cut someone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had <em>cut</em> someone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her hands were shaking.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The copper scent of blood clung to the air.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She forced herself to breathe.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then she looked up.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The man in the scarf was gone.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">• Arana realizes she isn’t just <em>being watched</em>—she is <em>being tested.</em><br>• The moment she truly understands why Liam gave her the knife.<br>• She hesitates before using it—but not for long.

The alley was empty save for the stray dogs rummaging through piles of discarded refuse, their ribs just as sharp as hers beneath their mangy fur. The market’s din had faded with the setting sun, replaced by the distant echoes of drunkards laughing and the rhythmic stomp of patrolling boots.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her stomach twisted in protest, an empty ache that had become too familiar. The bruises on her arms and legs had barely begun to fade, and new ones had already bloomed beneath the dirt smudging her skin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Today had been one of the <em>bad</em> days.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had picked the wrong target—an old woman with sharp eyes and even sharper nails. The moment Arana’s fingers had brushed the woman’s coin purse, a bony hand had clamped down on her wrist with an iron grip. She had tried to twist free, but the woman had <em>screamed</em> for the guards before she could even react.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The crowd had turned fast.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Hands had grabbed at her, voices had shouted, and then the blows had come. She hadn’t even seen who had hit her first—just the impact, the sudden burst of pain, the way her knees had buckled.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had escaped, barely, scrambling out of the fray before the guards could drag her to the stocks again. But she hadn’t gotten anything for it. No food. No coins.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Nothing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And now, she had nothing left in her but exhaustion.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She pressed a hand to her ribs where a particularly vicious kick had landed. A few days of luck had made her cocky. It wouldn’t happen again.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She heard footsteps.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not heavy. Not the clanking rhythm of guards.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Lighter. Quieter. Purposeful.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana didn’t look up. She knew who it was before he even spoke.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He crouched beside her, resting his arms on his knees. The dim twilight cast a soft glow over his face, his green eyes sharp but unreadable.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He didn’t smirk. He didn’t offer her some smug remark about getting her ass kicked. He just watched her for a long moment, as if measuring something she couldn’t see.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, finally, he spoke.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>“You want to eat?”</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His voice was flat.

He stood, shoving his hands into his pockets as he turned away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He wasn’t offering her a hand up.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He wasn’t offering her anything.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was an invitation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A door she could walk through, or one she could ignore.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana sat there for a long moment, her fingers curling into the dirt.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wasn’t stupid.

Lanterns swung on their posts, their dim glow barely piercing the thickening night. The city behind her was alive—drunken laughter spilled from taverns, boots clattered against cobblestones, the distant clang of a blacksmith still working echoed down the streets. But here, at the edges of Sovalis, the world was quieter.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana moved carefully, her fingers brushing against the knife tucked in her belt. She had no idea why she had brought it, or what she thought it would do for her. She had no plans to use it. Not yet.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam walked ahead of her, weaving through the alleyways like he had done it a thousand times before. She had pestered him with questions the entire way, but he had only offered a few noncommittal shrugs and quick glances over his shoulder, as if making sure she was still following.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">More than once, he had motioned for her to shut up.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The unease in her stomach grew.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She thought, suddenly, that she should turn back.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This was stupid.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She was walking blind into something she didn’t understand, into a part of the city she barely knew.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But then she remembered the bruises. The hunger.

Just for a breath.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then she followed.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The building was an old dockworker’s office, long since abandoned, half of its structure leaning precariously toward the water. It smelled of mildew and rot, but it was dry inside, sheltered from the wind that was whipping up from the river. A single lantern flickered near the center of the room, casting jagged shadows across the broken floorboards.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And there, seated on a wooden crate, was the man in the scarf.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana stopped dead.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She knew his face.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not well. Not personally. But she had seen him watching. In the market. In the alleyways. Silent. Measuring.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He was larger up close than she had expected. Broad shoulders, thick arms, hands calloused like someone who had spent a lifetime working them raw. His beard was streaked with grey, his dark eyes deep-set and unreadable beneath the hood of his scarf.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">For a long moment, he said nothing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, in a voice that was deep, rough, and edged with something dangerous, he spoke.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“So. You came.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It wasn’t a question.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam grinned beside her, rocking back on his heels.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana swallowed, forcing her shoulders to square.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The man—Grizz—tilted his head, studying her like one might examine a stray dog, weighing whether it was worth the trouble of taking in.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Smart. Fast. Desperate. I’ve seen worse.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His voice was like gravel scraping against stone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana tensed. She didn’t like how easily he could pick her apart.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“What do you want?”</strong> she asked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz let out a short, humorless chuckle.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“What do I want? That’s not the question, kid. The question is, what do <em>you</em> want?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He leaned forward, elbows resting on his knees.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“You don’t have to be here. You can go back to picking scraps, getting your ribs cracked. Maybe you’ll make it to next winter. Maybe not.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He gestured vaguely at the shadows flickering along the walls.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Or you can make something of yourself. No one’s gonna give you anything, girl. You take it, or you starve.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s fingers clenched into fists.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hated how true it was.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wanted to snap back, to say something sharp, to prove she wasn’t just some kid who needed saving.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But the words died before they could leave her tongue.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Because she wasn’t stupid.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And she knew he was right.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz watched her closely.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, as if satisfied by what he saw, he leaned back and exhaled through his nose.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Alright, then.

Arana followed, her mind racing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wasn’t sure what she had just agreed to.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she knew it was too late to change her mind now.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam led them toward the high-end taverns near the docks, where the rich drank themselves into oblivion and the city guard turned a blind eye to the right pockets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz’s voice was low, but firm.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“You steal from them, not from the market, not from the people scraping by. You take from the ones who won’t feel the loss.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He paused, then added with a dry smirk,</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“And the ones too drunk to notice.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam snorted. Arana said nothing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The plan was simple.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz and Liam would create a distraction—a fight, a drunken argument, loud enough to turn heads.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s job was to move through the crowd, light-fingered and invisible, lifting coin purses before the chaos settled.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This wasn’t picking pockets in the market. This wasn’t stealing apples from a vendor’s cart.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This was actual crime.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But it was also control.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her heart was hammering in her ribs, but she nodded once.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She could do this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She <em>had</em> to do this.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">• <strong>Arana meets Grizz</strong> face to face for the first time.<br>• <strong>Grizz never directly tells her he has been watching her—but he makes it clear she was chosen.</strong><br>• <strong>Arana’s decision isn’t immediate.</strong> Grizz forces her to weigh her options, making her choice feel like a defining moment.<br>• <strong>The job is set.</strong> This is no longer just about survival—this is about playing the game of the streets.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visual:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana moving through the night, her pulse pounding in her ears, Grizz’s words still echoing in her mind.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>“You take it, or you starve.”</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wasn’t sure if she was ready.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she had already made her choice.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>What This Scene Does for the Chapter:</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Reinforces the power dynamics.</strong> Grizz doesn’t recruit.

Here, in the heart of the merchant district, the air was thick with the scent of spiced wine, roasted meats, and the sweet perfume of expensive courtesans drifting between the revelers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The cobblestones gleamed under lantern light, polished smooth by the boots of the wealthy. Men in embroidered coats stumbled from the tavern doors, voices slurred, arms slung over each other’s shoulders, laughter spilling into the streets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana had never been this close before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had watched from a distance, had seen the way money flowed like water in places like this.

Something loud, something no one wants to take their eyes off of.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana had nodded, barely breathing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“And you?” Liam had grinned at her, walking backward as they moved. “You move through them while they’re looking at us. Fast. Clean. If they notice you, we all run, and I swear I’ll make you regret it.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana had glared at him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she had understood.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She was small, quick, forgettable. That was what made her useful.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The trick was to make sure she stayed that way.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Execution</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam and Grizz walked into the tavern like they belonged there.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana kept to the shadows, loitering just outside, her stomach knotted so tightly she thought she might be sick.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then she heard it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A chair scraping back. A heavy thud. The sound of glass shattering.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then—Grizz’s voice, thick with exaggerated drunkenness.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“You lying bastard!”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The door burst open, and Liam went flying out of it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s breath caught.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He hit the cobblestones hard, rolling onto his back, a bloody smear on his lip. Grizz stormed after him, his face twisted in fury.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">People turned. Voices hushed. The crowd in the street parted, making room for the inevitable.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was a brilliant scene.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The kind of fight rich men liked to watch—lowborns tearing each other apart for reasons no one really cared about.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“You think you can cheat me?”</strong> Grizz roared, lunging for Liam.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam scrambled up, staggering, wiping at his mouth with the back of his sleeve.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“You’re mad, old man,”</strong> he spat, his grin sharp, his eyes gleaming with something Arana recognized as pure enjoyment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz swung.

The crowd cheered.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">No one was watching their pockets.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Arana’s Move</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She slid into the throng, slipping between bodies, her fingers light as air.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A flash of silver. A purse dangling from a belt.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She moved without thinking, without hesitating.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">One.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Two.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Three.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was easier than she had imagined. The drunker they were, the heavier their purses, the less they noticed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her pulse pounded, her breath shallow.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This was working.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>A hand closed around her wrist.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her stomach flipped.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A man. One of the wealthier ones, judging by the gold trim on his coat. His grip was iron around her thin wrist, his expression dark.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“What do we have here?”</strong> he murmured, eyes narrowing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her mind screamed at her to run.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She twisted, trying to wrench free. His grip only tightened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Little thief.”</strong> His voice was thick with wine, but his hold was steady.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Panic surged up her throat. She tried to pull her knife, but his other hand clamped over her arm before she could reach it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She was caught.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Think, think, think—</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then, over his shoulder, she saw Liam.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He was still grinning, his lip split, blood drying on his chin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And he was looking right at her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Waiting.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Because this was still part of the game.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family:

style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The man frowned, caught off guard by her sudden lack of resistance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then, with all the strength she had, she jerked forward and <strong>sank her teeth into his hand.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He <strong>yelled.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was all the opening she needed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wrenched free, twisting under his arm, <strong>kicked him hard in the shin,</strong> and bolted.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Right as <strong>Liam lunged back into the fight.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The moment he collided with Grizz, the whole crowd exploded again—cheers, groans, coin being exchanged on bets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana was already gone.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Aftermath</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She ran until she couldn’t hear the fight anymore.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Until the streets were quiet again.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then she ducked into an alley, her heart hammering, her pulse a sharp, uneven rhythm in her ears.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She touched her sleeve.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was heavy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had <strong>gotten away with it.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her lips parted, a breathless, disbelieving smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And then—footsteps.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She turned, half-expecting pursuit, half-expecting the wealthy man, furious and red-faced—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But it was <strong>Liam.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He wasn’t out of breath.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He was grinning again, teeth flashing in the low light.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Not bad.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He tossed something at her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She caught it without thinking.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A purse.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Another one.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She looked up at him, confused.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He smirked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Good enough.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,

The adrenaline had faded, leaving behind exhaustion and something sharper—something like hunger, but deeper.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam was sprawled on the floor against a pile of burlap sacks, his legs stretched out lazily in front of him, as if he had all the time in the world. He was still grinning, still riding the high of the job.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz sat across from them, rolling a coin across the back of his fingers.

A small pile of mixed silver and copper spilled out, glinting in the low light.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz counted it methodically, sliding coins into separate stacks. He made no comment about how much she had taken. No praise. No scolding.

He picked up the remaining coin and disappeared into the shadows of the office, leaving only the dim lantern light in his wake.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam was still watching her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She could feel it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“So,” he drawled, tipping his head toward her. “What’d you think?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana met his gaze.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She could tell he already knew.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It wasn’t what she had expected.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It wasn’t some great victory.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">There was no moment of belonging, no warmth, no sense of having found something more than survival.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was just another day.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Just another job.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And yet—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her fingers curled around the stolen coin in her pocket.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">For the first time in a long time, she wasn’t thinking about where her next meal would come from.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had earned this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had done it herself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And that meant something.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam smirked, shaking his head like he had seen this realization before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He got up, stretching his arms, his movements slow and lazy. “Get used to it, new girl,” he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then he was gone too.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points:</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">• <strong>Arana officially becomes part of Grizz’s operation—but it’s clear this is not a family.</strong><br>• <strong>She learns the truth of the streets: work, survive, repeat.

Easy targets. Quick work.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Or at least, it should have been.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But the shopkeeper had seen them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The second Liam grabbed the coin pouch from the counter, the old man turned faster than they expected, and a shout tore through the street.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s stomach lurched.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then they were running.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She bolted into the alley, heart hammering as she weaved between carts and barrels. Liam was ahead of her, cursing under his breath. Grizz was behind, slower but steady, his boots pounding against the cobblestones.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They had gotten cocky.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And now the city watch was after them.</span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 2: No Other Choice (Plot Turn 1 – They need a place to hide.)</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> The winding streets of Sovalis<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Night, lanterns flickering in doorways<br><strong>Weather:</strong> The wind picks up, carrying the distant scent of rain<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Arana<br><strong>Time Passed Since Previous Scene:</strong> Minutes</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Where?” Liam gasped as they turned another corner, boots skidding on loose stones.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s mind raced. She had always kept her house a secret. It was hers. It was the only place in the world that was still hers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But they couldn’t keep running.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hesitated—just for a second.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then she made her choice.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“This way!” she hissed, veering off into a side alley, leading them through the maze of darkened streets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz grunted but followed. Liam didn’t question it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She led them through the winding paths of the old district, past shuttered windows and empty doorways. The streets blurred into memories—her father’s voice, her mother’s laughter, the warmth of home.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then the house loomed before them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Small. Worn. Forgotten.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But still standing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana shoved open the door, ushering them inside before slamming it shut.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They had made it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">For now.</span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 3: The First Impressions (Pinch Point 1 – Liam sees the house, Grizz reacts.)</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> Inside Arana’s house<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Midnight<br><strong>Weather:</strong> The wind rattles the windows<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Arana</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam whistled low, turning in a slow circle.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You’ve been living here?” He ran a hand along the dusty table. “Alone? This whole time?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana crossed her arms, defensive. “Yeah. So?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam let out a breathy laugh. “Gods. I sleep under a damn awning most nights. This—this is a whole house.” He dropped onto a chair like he belonged there.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana didn’t like how warm that made her feel.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But Grizz didn’t laugh.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He stood still, eyes scanning the walls, the floor, the hearth.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Something about him changed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His usual gruffness deepened into something darker, something Arana had never seen in him before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Where did you say you got this house?” he asked, voice tight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana stiffened. “I didn’t get it.

He sat stiffly by the fire, staring into the dying embers, his jaw clenched so tightly it looked like it hurt.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam had long since curled up in the corner, already half-asleep on a pile of old blankets, but Arana hadn’t moved from where she sat. She couldn’t.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Something was coming.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She could feel it in the way Grizz exhaled, in the way he finally, slowly, turned to look at her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You remind me of them,” he said at last, his voice low, gravelly. “Your parents.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her breath caught in her throat.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The words hit her like a physical blow, even though she had been expecting them the moment he recognized her house.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You knew them?” Her voice came out sharper than she intended.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz nodded once. “Aelius and Mirah. They were my friends.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Something deep inside her twisted, a part of her she had kept locked away for so long she barely recognized it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Prove it.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hadn’t meant to challenge him, but she couldn’t just take his word for it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz didn’t look offended. If anything, he looked like he had expected her reaction.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Your father,” he said slowly, “used to sketch everything. Anything that caught his eye. He had a habit of doodling on the edges of important papers, which drove your mother mad.” He huffed a small laugh. “Mirah was always fussing at him to stop wasting ink.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana swallowed hard.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">That was true.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">That was real.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She remembered it—the countless nights when she would sit at the table, watching her father’s hands move across the parchment, watching her mother shake her head but smile all the same.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she wasn’t ready to let her guard down just yet.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“And my mother?” she asked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz’s expression softened in a way she had never seen before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“She sewed stars into everything,” he said simply. “Even when she didn’t need to. Little ones, stitched into the edges of cloaks, onto the hems of dresses, hidden in the linings.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s fingers dug into her palms.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She fingered the cloak she was wearing, the last thing her mother had made for her. It had a little star at the hem. And her mother used to call her that.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The air in the room suddenly felt too thick. Too heavy. Her mind screamed at her to stop this conversation, to push it all down where it belonged.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she couldn’t.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not this time.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She forced herself to meet his gaze. “What happened to you?” she asked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz’s expression darkened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I was taken,” he admitted, voice tight. “They sent me north, to a labor camp. I was there for years. When I came back to this cursed city, everything had turned upside down.

Not tonight. Maybe not ever.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Instead, she just nodded, the words settling into something deep inside her.</span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 7: A Strange Kind of Family (Pinch Point 2 – She Makes a Choice)</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> Arana’s house, by the flickering fire<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> The first light of dawn creeping through the cracks in the shutters<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Arana</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They sat in silence for a long time after that.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam, who had been pretending to be asleep, finally stretched, groaning. “Gods, you two are depressing,” he muttered. He sat up, rubbing his eyes, then smirked at Arana. “You got a whole damn house. I’m staying.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana blinked at him. “What?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam shrugged. “What, you want me to go back to sleeping in a goddamn alley? No thanks. This is the best place I’ve ever been in.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana stared at him, trying to figure out if he was joking. But his expression was earnest—blunt, straightforward, as if it had never occurred to him that she might say no.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And she realized, she didn’t want to say no.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam had been a presence in her life for weeks now. Maybe she hadn’t asked for him, but he had been there. Watching her back. Teaching her things, even if he didn’t say it outright.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And Grizz—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her eyes flicked toward him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz was still staring at the fire, his expression unreadable.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Finally, he exhaled.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You don’t want me here,” he said, more statement than question.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana hesitated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Did she?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t know.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t want to be alone anymore. But letting people in meant they could leave. That was worse than never having them at all.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Still—</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You can stay,” she said, surprising even herself. “Both of you.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam grinned. “See? Told you I was staying.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz didn’t answer right away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But when he finally looked at her, there was something different in his expression.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not softness. Not quite.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She saw pain and rage. But she knew it was not directed at her. Nonetheless it scared her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You sure about that?” he asked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana met his gaze without flinching.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Yeah,” she said. “I’m sure.”</span></p><hr><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 8: The Silent Understanding (Climax – Grizz Makes His Decision)</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> Arana’s house, now holding more people than it ever has before<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> The sun rising, spilling gold across the floorboards<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Grizz</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz wasn’t sure what had made him stay.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He knew what this meant.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He had sworn he wouldn’t get involved in things like this again.

A place she <strong>lived</strong>, but never quite belonged.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Now, <strong>there were voices.</strong> The scrape of boots on old floorboards. The low murmur of Grizz and Liam talking in the other room. The scent of stew, thin but hot, filling the air.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam had taken the small storeroom as his space, though he rarely used it.

She had heard stories, of course—stories whispered in market stalls and over cheap drinks in the docks. A place of <strong>laughter and excess, of music and sin, of masked strangers and gilded lies.</strong> But hearing about it and seeing it were two different things.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Lanterns in shades of deep crimson, gold, and violet <strong>hung from rooftops and swayed in the evening breeze, bathing the streets in warm, flickering color.</strong> The glow reflected off polished stones, off the elaborate signs of music halls and theaters, off the painted faces of performers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Music spilled from open doorways, blending together in an intoxicating mess of sounds—<strong>the steady pulse of drums, the weeping of violins, the slow, lazy strum of a lute.</strong> In one tavern, a man with silvered hair recited a poem to an enraptured crowd. In another, <strong>dancers twirled in half-sheer silks, laughter and clinking glasses punctuating the melody of flutes.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This was <strong>not</strong> the world Arana knew.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She tensed, wary, glancing at Grizz. He walked forward at a slow, steady pace, <strong>a man who had been here before and had no fear of it.</strong> Liam, by contrast, was <strong>grinning like a fool,</strong> his sharp eyes darting between the performers, the crowds, the food stalls with sizzling meat skewers and candied nuts.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“This,” Liam announced, <strong>“is my new favorite place in the whole godsdamned city.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana scowled. “It smells like perfume and bad choices.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam cackled. “Exactly.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz sighed but didn’t comment. He led them deeper into the Lantern Quarter, navigating the maze of <strong>winding streets that pulsed with energy, each turn revealing something new.</strong> A man dressed in royal colors played a harp with expert precision. Across the street, an old woman with tattoos covering her arms told a story in a language Arana didn’t recognize, her words punctuated with the occasional gasp of her audience.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">There were <strong>writers, scholars, poets, actors.</strong> And then, there were <strong>the brothels.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Some, <strong>bright and extravagant,</strong> with names like <em>The Velvet Garden</em> and <em>The House of Delights,</em> had <strong>wealthy patrons draped in silks and laughter.</strong> Others, smaller, dimmer, looked more like <strong>a last resort.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Stay out of those,” Grizz muttered. He didn’t need to say which ones.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They passed a man in priestly robes, <strong>his face red, the front of his cassock wrinkled and hastily re-tied.</strong> He muttered something under his breath and hurried in the opposite direction.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana smirked. “Priests aren’t supposed to be here, right?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz snorted. “Priests aren’t supposed to do a lot of things.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana <strong>felt a sick sense of satisfaction at that.</strong> The Church talked about purity, about devotion, about casting out the unworthy—yet their own slipped into <strong>sin-soaked alleyways, paying to forget.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, they turned a corner.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And she saw <strong>the real reason the Lantern Quarter felt wrong.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Forget-Me-Not.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>blue haze of it</strong> curled out of a long pipe, held in delicate fingers, <strong>a woman exhaling smoke with a vacant, glassy stare.</strong> The smell was sweet, <strong>like honey and dried flowers,</strong> but Arana had learned that the prettier something smelled, the nastier it often was, especially when it came to people.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Two men sat in the alley, <strong>their hands trembling, their eyes hollowed,</strong> the faint, unnatural grin of the Smiling Rot clinging to their slack faces.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They weren’t <strong>dead.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But they were <strong>gone.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz grabbed her shoulder, steering her away before she could stop and stare. “Don’t get too close,” he muttered.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I wasn’t going to,” Arana snapped, but her voice felt thin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had heard the stories. But seeing it—seeing the <strong>forgetting,</strong> the slow unraveling of a person before they even died—<strong>that was different.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam was quiet.

People <strong>shared what little they had.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But the <strong>northwestern slum?</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">That was <strong>different.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">As they crossed the bridge over the Jarun, the <strong>stench hit first.</strong> The river carried <strong>the city’s filth</strong> along these streets, a slow-moving sludge that turned the air sour. The buildings were <strong>more ruins than homes,</strong> sagging under their own weight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">There was <strong>no real market here.</strong> Just a few stalls, selling <strong>half-rotten food, spoiled meat, old scraps.</strong> The people here didn’t <strong>just struggle.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They <strong>starved.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The few figures that lingered in the alleys were <strong>gaunt,</strong> their faces hollow, their clothes hanging from their frames.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana had never seen a place like this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz walked ahead, unmoved. “Most people don’t come here,” he said. “Not unless they have to.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam looked uneasy. <strong>“Why are we here, then?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz didn’t answer right away. Instead, he pointed at a <strong>crumbling structure near the river.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A church.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not the grand, shining cathedrals from the center of Sovalis. This one was <strong>small, battered, barely holding together.</strong> But it had <strong>people lining up for food.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Clerics stood at the doors, handing out <strong>stale bread and thin soup.</strong> The people took it <strong>without looking them in the eye.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The Church didn’t <strong>hunt people here.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It <strong>kept them quiet.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Why feed them if they don’t care about them?” Arana asked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz gave her a long, slow look.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Because starving people riot,” he said. “People with just enough? They don’t.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The answer <strong>sank into her like a stone.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">This wasn’t kindness.<br>It was control.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She looked around again, taking in the <strong>sick, the hungry, the forgotten.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">No one here had names.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And <strong>if they died, no one would notice.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam cleared his throat. “So, uh.

        "ChapterText": "<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The grand dining hall stretched wider than necessary, its long table polished to a dull sheen. <strong>The fire in the hearth burned low, its warmth swallowed by the vastness of the chamber.</strong> Despite the golden light of the chandeliers, the mountain stone always felt cool beneath his fingertips when he traced the carved edges of the table.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric sat alone, as he often did.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father’s chair remained empty for now, but the place was set. That meant he was coming. <strong>Not every night, but some nights.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The servant moved quietly as he placed down a fresh cut of venison and a bowl of root vegetables. The scent of cloves and rosemary mixed with the woodsmoke, <strong>familiar, steady.</strong> The palace ran on routine, on discipline.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric picked up his knife and fork, cutting precisely as he had been taught. <strong>No wasted movement, no unnecessary mess.</strong> His father always said that a man who could not control his own hands had no business ruling others.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A door opened at the far end of the hall, and his father entered.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">King Alistair moved with purpose, his fur-lined cloak trailing slightly behind him. <strong>His presence always changed a room.</strong> Even in the quiet, Edric could feel the shift, the air seeming to tighten as the servants straightened, as the warmth of the fire felt a little stronger.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Edric.” His voice carried easily, though it held no sharpness. He was not displeased.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Father,” Edric greeted, setting down his utensils as the king took his seat.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The servants moved like clockwork, bringing new dishes—roasted game, black bread, thick cuts of cheese. Alistair did not immediately reach for his food. Instead, he took a slow look around the room, his gaze passing over the empty seats.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You eat well?” he asked, finally settling his eyes on Edric.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Yes,” Edric answered.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father gave a small nod, then picked up his own knife.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They ate in the quiet for a while. Not uncomfortable silence, just <strong>expectant.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair was a man of presence, a man who did not speak unless the words meant something. <strong>There was no idle chatter with him, no unnecessary softness, but there was always intention.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">After a few minutes, he finally spoke.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“What did you learn today?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric straightened slightly. He knew the answer was not just about what he had been taught, but what he had taken from it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I had lessons on the history of Veridian and the laws regarding the rights of trade between dominions,” he answered carefully. “Master Callas says understanding them will prevent disputes.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father gave a small, approving nod. “And do you think that’s true?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric hesitated. He thought about the ledgers, the disputes, the careful agreements he had been shown.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I think laws do not stop people from wanting more than they are given,” he said after a moment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A pause.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, his father let out a quiet chuckle. “Good. You are learning.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric felt something settle inside him. <strong>Not warmth exactly, but something steady. Something solid.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father did not waste praise.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But when he gave it, he meant it.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Refinement Questions:</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Do you want Alistair to show a bit more warmth?</strong> Maybe a hand on Edric’s shoulder, or a more direct show of pride?</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Should Edric push further with his thoughts?</strong> Or is his restraint part of his character development?</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Do you want a contrast with his past lessons?</strong> Perhaps hinting at how he used to struggle with these questions, but has grown into them?</span></p></li></ol><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 2: The Weight of a Kingdom</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>(The father behind the crown, and the child behind the heir.)</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> The King’s Study, Mountain Palace of Sheen<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Late evening, the oil lamps casting golden halos of light<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Early autumn, the cold creeping in through the mountain passes<br><strong>Weather:</strong> A quiet drizzle against the windows, the scent of damp stone and parchment in the air<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Edric (Age 8)</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The study was one of Edric’s favorite places in the palace.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was warm, lined with shelves of books and maps, the fire always burning low in the hearth. His father’s heavy desk sat at the far end of the room, covered in neatly arranged parchment and thick-bound ledgers, the scent of ink and candle wax lingering in the air.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father sat behind the desk now, quill scratching against paper. The only sound in the room was the occasional crackle of the fire and the distant tapping of rain against the windows.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric, however, was <strong>not</strong> quiet.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“…and the brown dog, the big one with the torn ear—he’s the fastest, I swear it! Even faster than the black one. He ran all the way from the kennels to the lower gate before I even made it halfway!”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father gave a small, distracted hum, still focused on the paper in front of him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Encouraged, Edric kept going. “Master Rellen says the dogs are trained for hunting, but I think they listen to me better. Maybe because I bring them scraps when the cooks aren’t looking.” He grinned, proud of himself. “I want to go hunting soon. Proper hunting. Not just running in the fields pretending.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Still, no response.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric trailed off, watching his father’s face. The candlelight flickered over his furrowed brow, deepening the lines of focus and fatigue. His father always carried the weight of the crown, but tonight, it seemed heavier.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He hesitated, then softly asked, <strong>“Father… what’s wrong?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The quill stilled.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father exhaled slowly, setting the pen aside. He rubbed a hand over his temple before meeting Edric’s gaze.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“There have been more reports,” Alistair said at last.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric straightened slightly. “From the Order?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father shook his head. “From all over Veridian.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He leaned back in his chair, his voice steady but heavy. “Spring floods came too strong, drowning crops before they could take root. The summer heat followed, drying what little remained. Villages struggle to feed themselves. In the north, an earthquake collapsed part of the fjord, blocking the main trade route. The merchants in the cities feel it first, but soon it will reach the villages. The people.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric frowned, trying to grasp the weight of those words.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Can’t they… move the rocks… with magic?”</strong> he asked hesitantly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father drew in a sharp breath.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Every mention of magic made his father’s expression darken. <strong>Even from him.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“That is what the Wild magicians do,” his father said firmly. There was no anger in his voice, but there was something worse, <strong>worry.</strong> “That is what the Wild Magicians <strong>did.</strong> Their heresy makes the gods angry son. What we do is pray to the gods. And our Divine magicians tell them what to do. If we are devout enough, the gods will help. You should know that by now, Edric. You are a future king. You have to learn. To know.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He shook his head, exhaling slowly. <strong>“Either way, it will take time. And in the meantime, people are suffering.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric sat with that for a moment. His fingers curled slightly in his lap.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Okay, then we pray more. Make the gods smite!” </strong>He thumps his little fist on the desk, making a barely audible thud.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father smiled at him then. A real smile. But it was tinged with something else—something sad.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, after a moment, he let out a slow breath and shook his head. <strong>“I forget sometimes.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric tilted his head. <strong>“Forget what?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father sighed. <strong>“That you are still just a child.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The words <strong>unsettled him.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father’s voice was not sharp, not scolding, but… <strong>regretful.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Am not!”</strong> Edric proclaimed, bold as only a small boy could be.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair chuckled at that.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You should be worrying about the dogs and the hunts, not failed harvests and trade routes,” he said, shaking his head. “I’m sorry, Edric. For burdening you so early with these things. You shouldn’t have to think of such matters, but I need you to know about them.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric sat up straighter. “I <strong>am</strong> old enough to know things! Like that Brenna is in love with Jude from the kitchens—<strong>and</strong> that Varick is a stiff prick.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father <strong>burst out laughing.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric grinned, delighted by the reaction.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“A stiff prick, is he? And where have you heard that, son?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric hesitated, then mimicked the roundabout hand gesture he had seen the adults use. <strong>“Around.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father let out another chuckle, shaking his head. “Well… they’re not wrong.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The warmth of that moment lingered between them, stretching like a thin golden thread.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But then his father’s expression turned <strong>serious again.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“One day,” he said, “I won’t be here anymore, Edric. And you will have to make choices for all the people of Veridian.” He exhaled, his eyes flickering with something Edric couldn’t name. “I need them to be <strong>good</strong> choices. The <strong>right</strong> choices. Choices that help us <strong>defeat the Wild magicians forever,</strong> so we can all be safe and happy.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric swallowed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father had spoken of ‘one day’ before. But this time, it didn’t feel like something far away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It felt… <strong>close.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points:</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Edric’s growing awareness of the burdens of rulership.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Alistair’s exhaustion—his fear that time is running out, that Veridian is still vulnerable.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>A glimpse of warmth in their relationship—Alistair is still a father, not just a king.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Edric’s belief in the gods is still pure, but his father’s faith seems weighed down by doubt.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The mention of magic immediately darkens Alistair’s mood, reinforcing his fear of its presence.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Hints of Varick’s reputation, which will be relevant later.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visual:</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Edric’s bold grin fading into something quieter as his father’s words settle.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The fire crackling in the hearth, its warmth not quite reaching the growing weight in the room.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Alistair watching his son, measuring the boy who would one day take his place.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Refinement Questions:</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Do you want Alistair to soften further at the end, or should the tension linger?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Would you like Edric to ask more questions, pressing about ‘one day’ and what it really means?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Should we hint at more specific events that have Alistair so concerned—something beyond the natural disasters?</strong></span></p></li></ol><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 3: Shadows of the Future</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>(Alistair’s worry deepens, the weight of the crown pressing heavier than ever.)</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> The King’s Study, Mountain Palace of Sheen<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Late night, the candles burning low<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Early autumn, the winds howling against the mountain walls<br><strong>Weather:</strong> A rising storm outside, rain tapping against the windowpanes<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> <strong>King Alistair</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The storm had begun to swell outside, wind pressing against the stone walls of the palace like a living thing, rattling the heavy wooden shutters. The mountain air was cold and biting, even here, in the sanctuary of the royal study. The candles flickered low, their golden light dancing along the edges of the room’s dark wood and scattered parchment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair poured himself a measure of <strong>black brandy</strong> and set the bottle aside with a dull thud. He hadn’t touched it in months. Tonight, though… tonight, his thoughts were darker than usual.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Across the desk, <strong>Varick</strong> sat in the same chair he always did when he called him to his study. His face was unreadable as ever, the flickering light making his deep-set eyes seem even more shadowed. His eyes were uncomfortably unblinking, his lips thin and tight, his hands folded neatly atop his lap. There was something in his stillness, that always made Alistair a little uneasy, stiff like a prick, Alistar felt a chuckle rising, despite his bitter mood.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He did not speak right away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He turned the heavy ring on his finger, a habit when his mind wandered too far into dark territory.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">When he finally broke the silence, his voice was quieter than he meant it to be. <strong>“He spoke of magic again.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick did not react outwardly. He rarely did.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The High Inquisitor simply tilted his head ever so slightly, watching the king with measured patience. “A dangerous habit. But the boy is young, Your Majesty. Children speak of many things.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair exhaled slowly. <strong>“It’s more than that.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He leaned forward, pressing his fingertips against his temple. “He dreams of it. He… <strong>wonders</strong> about it.” The last word was spoken with an almost bitter edge. “He should know better by now. He knows what the Wild magicians have done. And yet—he still asks.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick’s fingers curled slightly into each other, but his voice remained smooth. <strong>“And what would you have me do?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair scoffed, shaking his head. “Nothing. Not yet.” He took a sip of brandy, letting the burn settle deep in his chest. “He is just a boy. But that will not be true forever.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick said nothing. He let the weight of the words settle.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick inclined his head. “Of course.” A pause. Then, voice smooth as silk, he added, “Though, if you wish for a more… <em>lasting</em> lesson, there are ways.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair narrowed his eyes. “Speak plainly.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick’s lips curled ever so slightly. Not a smile. Something colder.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“A demonstration,” he said, voice smooth. “A controlled setting. A chance for the prince to see <em>truth</em> with his own eyes, before his mind is clouded by sentimental nonsense.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair stiffened. He felt where this was going, but he let Varick continue.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“The inquisitors have captured three heretics in the past month. One a woman, two men. Each sworn to the false gods, each caught in acts of treasonous magic.” Varick’s fingers drummed lightly against the chair’s armrest. “One of them claims innocence. Naturally.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair felt his grip tighten around the base of his glass.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Imagine the lesson,” Varick continued. “The prince, watching with his own eyes what Wild magic truly is. No fairy tales, no gilded illusions, no childish <em>wondering.</em> Just truth.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His voice dropped, his words slow and deliberate.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“A heretic pleading their innocence, forced to sit and wait, trembling fingers, a coward, pressed just enough until they <em>reach</em> for their power, their own instincts betraying them. And the moment it happens—” He exhaled, his fingers tightening slightly, as if savoring the thought.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Enough...” his voice was low and raw.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The inquisitor did not blink. “Or,” he said almost excitedly, as though he had not been interrupted, “we simply <strong>let them sit. </strong>A few days without release, and they begin to tremble. Another few days, and the convulsions begin. The shivering, the dizziness, the hallucinations.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His tone did not change, but there was something dark beneath it, something almost <em>reverent.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“If the boy watches them long enough, you know…” He waved his hand almost casually.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>Alistair did know</em>. He had seen it firsthand. Had ordered it himself, executions, purges. And yet, he had never thought of it this way. This felt personal.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>“Enough.” he repeated, the word dripping from between his lips.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick continued, untouched by the king’s intervention. “Or, if you wish for something swifter, we simply <strong>provoke them.</strong>” He spread his hands slightly. “Pain is a simple trigger. The instinct to <em>survive</em> always wins in the end. I could do it myself if your majesty wants me to.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A smile barely noticeably curled the edges of his lips.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair stood abruptly, his chair scraping loudly against the stone. “<em>Enough!</em>”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick stopped. His lips pressed together tightly trying to suppress that thin smile that was just tugging at him, though his eyes remained cold.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair <strong>gripped the edge of the desk,</strong> forcing himself to steady his breath.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“He is <em>eight years old,</em> Varick.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“A child who will one day rule a kingdom,” Varick countered, voice patient. “A child who will face enemies far crueler than a mere <em>demonstration.</em> A child who will have to give orders just like this himself. If he does not learn now, what a weak King he will be.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair clenched his fists.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick remained seated, perfectly composed, as though they were discussing the logistics of a trade route instead of <strong>ending a boy’s childhood.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The king turned away from him, staring out the rain-streaked window, his reflection a dark silhouette against the glass.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You are <strong>not</strong> to bring this to him,” Alistair said, voice low and firm. “You will not speak of it, not to my son, not to anyone.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick inclined his head slightly. “As you command, Your Majesty.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A silence stretched between them, heavy and unspoken.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, Alistair turned from the window, his voice quieter now.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“But soon,” he murmured, more to himself than to Varick, “he will have to learn.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick said nothing.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp;

His fingers gripped the edge of the fabric, his knuckles white as he stared at the ceiling. The stone was smooth, darkened by shadows from the dim candle on his bedside table. He could hear the soft patter of rain outside, the faint crackle of the dying hearth. The storm was over, but something still churned inside him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father’s words lingered.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>Their heresy makes the gods angry, son.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The gods. He had never thought about them being angry before. He had only ever thought of them as golden figures in the stained-glass windows of the cathedral, as the warm light that poured over the priests when they spoke of the divine. His father had told him before that the gods protected Veridian. But tonight, it had sounded different.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The gods were angry.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And Wild magicians were the cause.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He swallowed hard. He had always thought of Wild magicians as a distant thing—like the villains in the stories his tutors told him, the ones who were always defeated by noble knights and righteous kings. But the way his father spoke…</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It wasn’t a story.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was real.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A tightening feeling curled in his stomach. He sat up slowly, the heavy blankets pooling around his waist, the cold air biting at his skin. His gaze flicked to the tall arched window. The rain had slowed to a whisper, mist swirling over the darkened mountains beyond the glass.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He imagined, for the first time, Wild magicians moving through that mist.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Would they come here?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Could they?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A shiver crawled down his spine, and he shook his head sharply, pushing the thought away. No. The Order of Flame protected them. The inquisitors hunted them down. His father was the greatest king Veridian had ever known.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But then another thought surfaced—one he didn’t like.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">What if the Wild magicians didn’t just live in the mountains? What if they were in the villages? The cities? Hidden, waiting, pretending to be ordinary people? His father had said that some of them <em>looked</em> normal, that they lied, that they pretended to be harmless.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A twisting unease made his skin crawl.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">What if he had <em>seen</em> one before and hadn’t even known?</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Wrapping his arms wrapped tightly around his knees, Edric buried his face against them. No matter how much he tried to push them away, the thoughts kept circling, creeping in like whispers through the cracks in the stone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>The floods and earthquakes were because of them?</em><br><em>People were starving because of them?</em><br><em>What if the gods were angry at him, too, because he had thought magic was… fun?</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A tightness coiled in his chest, the weight of it pressing down until it was hard to breathe.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>Was that why the gods let his mother die?</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A sharp inhale. His breath hitched, unsteady. That thought had never come before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The priests always said his mother had been <em>called</em> to the gods, that her death had been part of their divine plan. But what if it hadn’t?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>What if it had been the Wild magicians?</em><br><em>What if magic had stolen her from him before he was even born?</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His heartbeat thundered in his ears, each beat like a hammer against his ribs. The room, once warm with candlelight, felt suddenly cold.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Squeezing his eyes shut, he willed the thoughts away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He wanted to go to his father, to hear that everything was alright, that Veridian was safe, that <em>he</em> was safe. Sitting beside him, listening to his steady voice, just knowing he was there, would make the fear fade.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But that was what a child would do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>Am not!</em> He had told his father that only hours ago. He had <em>meant</em> it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A shuddering breath left him. He would not act like a child now.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Instead, he slid off the bed, bare feet touching the cold stone floor. The sharp chill grounded him, but it did not ease the unease curling in his stomach. Kneeling beside the bedside table, he clasped his hands together, bowed his head, and whispered the words he had been taught.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But for the first time in his life, he did not pray because he had been told to.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He prayed because he was afraid.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Story Advancement &amp; Key Plot Points:</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Edric begins to truly fear Wild magic.</strong> The idea of it being a story in his head fades, and reality begins to take hold.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>For the first time, he questions his mother’s death.</strong> He had always accepted it as something beyond his understanding, but the idea that magic might have played a role plants a dark seed.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>His faith is strengthened—not out of devotion, but out of fear.</strong> He turns to the gods not with innocence, but with the first flicker of desperation.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>His trust in his father deepens, but his worldview narrows.</strong> He begins to see magic not as a concept, but as a real and immediate threat.</span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visuals:</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric kneeling in the dim candlelight, his small hands clasped tightly in prayer.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The flickering glow casting long shadows across the walls.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The rain misting over the dark mountains beyond the window.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The faint whisper of wind against the glass, almost like a breath.</span></p></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 6: The Last Days of Childhood</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>(The weight of responsibility settles, as a boy turns closer to a king.)</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location: Mountain Palace of Sheen, Edric’s Chamber → The King’s Study</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Time of Day: Early evening, the sun slipping behind the peaks</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Time of Year: Late Autumn, one week before Irrst Month (Edric’s birthday)</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Weather: Crisp and clear, the first signs of winter in the wind</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>POV Character: King Alistair</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Time Passed Since Previous Scene: Two months</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The boy had changed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair had seen it before in men—never in a child.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Two months ago, Edric had bounded into this study with the boundless energy of youth, talking of magic like it was a game. Now, as he watched from his chair, he saw the difference in every movement his son made. The way he carried himself, the way he measured his words before speaking. Even now, across the room, Edric sat at the edge of his bed, polishing the silver clasp of his riding cloak with slow, methodical strokes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He used to fidget. He used to hum under his breath when he was alone, distracted by whatever half-formed thought ran through his young mind. Now, he simply sat, back straight, eyes focused.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A week from now, he would turn <strong>nine years old</strong>. A boy still. But one who had learned fear.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair should have felt satisfaction in that. It was what he wanted. What he needed. A king could not be soft. And yet, <strong>watching his son like this, he felt the unfamiliar ache of regret settling somewhere deep inside him.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Your Majesty?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair turned at the soft voice of <strong>Brenna,</strong> standing in the doorway. <strong>His son’s nursemaid</strong> had been with him since birth, and her loyalty was never in question. She had never once challenged him before. Yet, tonight, there was something in her eyes that made his jaw tighten.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Edric is in your study, sire.” A pause. Then, softer, “I think you should speak with him.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair studied her for a moment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She never told him what to do.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Without another word, he stood and walked past her, down the candlelit halls of the mountain palace.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The Study – A King and His Son</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">When Alistair entered the <strong>dimly lit study,</strong> he found Edric sitting at his usual place, a book open in front of him. But he wasn’t reading.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He was staring at the candle in front of him, the small flame flickering as if it, too, felt the weight of the silence.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair let the heavy doors close behind him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“You are quiet tonight,”</strong> he observed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric’s fingers tightened slightly on the edge of the book. He nodded, but did not speak.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair exhaled, moving to the chair across from him. He let the silence stretch between them, waiting to see if Edric would break it first.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Finally, after a long pause, the boy spoke.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Will the gods help this year?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The words were soft, but heavy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair’s stomach tightened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Why do you ask?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric shifted slightly, his small hands tightening into fists in his lap. <strong>“Because I prayed, and the floods did not stop.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The air in the room grew heavier.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair leaned forward, resting his forearms on the table. “The gods listen. But they do not always answer in ways we understand.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric looked up at him then, <strong>eyes far too old for a child.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“What if they don’t answer at all?”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair let out a slow breath. He could not let his son slip into doubt, not now. Not ever.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>“Then we make them listen.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The boy’s expression did not change, but something flickered behind his eyes.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair recognized it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was the first ember of something sharp and unyielding. <strong>Not childish stubbornness. Not a tantrum.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Resolve.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And yet… his son was still so young.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair reached out, resting a hand on Edric’s shoulder. “You have done well.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric straightened under the touch, but said nothing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair felt the warmth of his son’s small frame beneath his palm, and something inside him clenched.

The heavy wooden shutters creaked against the force of it, but the stone walls of the study remained unmoved.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Inside, the chamber was <strong>dimly lit, suffused with the scent of ink and old parchment.</strong> The fire had burned low, the orange embers casting flickering shadows along the polished wood of the desk.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">King Alistair stood behind it, <strong>his arms crossed, his shoulders squared.</strong> His presence alone was enough to fill the space with unspoken weight. He did not sit. He did not pour himself a drink. He did not need the trappings of contemplation to know what had to be done.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick sat in the chair opposite, composed as ever, hands folded neatly in his lap, posture <strong>unerringly still.</strong> He did not fidget, did not shift. He simply <strong>watched.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair let the silence stretch, let the storm outside fill the space where words had not yet been spoken. Then, finally, his voice came low and measured:</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You have been teaching my son.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick inclined his head. “As you commanded, Your Majesty.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A pause.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair’s fingers curled slightly at his sides. “And what, exactly, have you been teaching him?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick blinked once. “The lessons befitting a future king. Politics, history, trade.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“And?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The inquisitor tilted his head ever so slightly, something <strong>unreadable flickering in his dark eyes.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Truths,” he said simply.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair’s jaw tensed. <strong>He had expected this answer. He had feared it.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I told you to teach him, not mold him in your own image.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick did not react, did not shrink beneath the accusation. If anything, his lips curled faintly, not quite a smile, something colder.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Your Majesty,” he said smoothly, “I have done only what was necessary.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair leaned forward, bracing his hands against the desk. The candlelight cast deep shadows across his face.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You do not decide what is necessary for my son.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick’s expression did not change. “And yet, you have hesitated. You tell him of dangers, but shield him from seeing them. You speak of power, yet refuse to let him witness its cost.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The king’s grip tightened against the wood. <strong>He hated that Varick spoke as though he were the only one who understood the burden of kingship.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick continued, unbothered. <strong>“Your son must be prepared. The world will not be kind to him.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair straightened, voice dangerously low. “And you believe I do not know that?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick’s gaze did not waver.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I have shown him the places where Wild magicians and the Divine have clashed,” he admitted. “Where families have been burned alive in their homes. Where children have been left orphaned in the streets, all because of their heresy.” He leaned back slightly, his tone almost contemplative. “You have told him stories. I have shown him what they left behind.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A <strong>cold weight</strong> settled in Alistair’s chest.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He should have been furious. <strong>But the anger was dulled by something worse—resignation.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric had changed. He had grown quieter, more serious. His boyish wonder had been chipped away too quickly. <strong>It was exactly what Alistair had wanted.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">So why did he feel as though he had lost something precious?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Silence stretched between them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Finally, Alistair exhaled, slow and controlled. <strong>“He is not to leave the palace grounds.”</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Varick did not react, as if he had already foreseen this outcome. “Of course, Your Majesty.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair straightened, his eyes like flint. “And no more of your stories.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A pause.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, finally, Varick inclined his head. “If that is your wish.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Alistair studied him for a moment longer, searching for any trace of defiance. But the inquisitor remained as unreadable as ever.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Still, Alistair knew—<strong>this was not the end of it.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visuals:</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The king standing at the window, watching the rain streak down the glass, his reflection cold and distant.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Varick’s silhouette framed by the firelight, unmoving, unreadable.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The doors closing between them with a quiet but final click.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>What This Scene Accomplishes:</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Confirms Alistair’s fears</strong>—Edric’s rapid change wasn’t just natural growth; <strong>Varick accelerated it.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Creates a turning point</strong>—Edric is <strong>confined to the palace grounds</strong>, marking a shift in his freedoms.</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Strengthens the theme of inevitability</strong>—Alistair <strong>wanted to shield his son, but the world is forcing his hand.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Further cements Varick’s influence</strong>—he remains <strong>patient, calculated, and always a step ahead.</strong></span></p></li></ol><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Refinement Questions:</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Would you like more insight into Alistair’s emotions here?</strong> Should his inner thoughts betray more of his regret, or should he remain guarded?</span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Does Varick’s dialogue feel appropriately manipulative, or should he push harder?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Would you like a more direct consequence for Varick’s actions—perhaps Alistair considering replacing him, but knowing he won’t?</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Should there be a moment of warmth for Alistair before the end of the scene?</strong> Or is the focus on his growing detachment from Edric the right choice?</span></p></li></ol><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 8: The Prince’s Ninth Name Day</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><em>(Opulence, defiance, and the shadow of fear—before the light of joy breaks through.)</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location: </strong>The Courtyards and Grand Hall of Sheen Palace</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Time of Day: </strong>Morning to Early Afternoon</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Time of Year: </strong>Irrst Month, early winter creeping in</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Weather: </strong>Crisp, cold air under a bright blue sky; snow dusting the peaks of the Pharr Mountains</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>POV Character: </strong>Edric (Age 9)</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Time Passed Since Previous Scene: </strong>A few weeks</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>A Morning of Celebration</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The palace had never been so <strong>alive.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The <strong>courtyards of Sheen Palace</strong> bustled with laughter, music, and the scent of roasting meats drifting on the cold morning air. The nobles of Veridian had arrived in their <strong>finest silks and furs,</strong> their children running about in the fresh snowfall, cheeks flushed pink. The noble sons of powerful families, close to Edric’s age, had been invited to <strong>compete in games</strong>—archery contests, horse races, and tests of wit and memory.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric had won more than half of them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He was the prince, after all.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He had spent the morning <strong>running, laughing, wrestling in the snow, and throwing jabs and boasts at the other boys.</strong> He felt strong, fast, clever.

His hands had been scrubbed raw again—he had tried to escape Brenna’s grip, but she had <strong>too much practice in catching him.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Before him, <strong>King Alistair stood tall,</strong> his fur-lined cloak draped over his shoulders, his expression carefully unreadable.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But Edric knew what was coming.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The hall quieted as a servant stepped forward, carrying <strong>a long wooden box.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric felt his pulse quicken.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>This was the moment.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The servant set the box before him. <strong>Inside, nestled in dark velvet, was a sword.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric reached for it without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was <strong>lighter than he expected,</strong> though still solid, <strong>perfectly sized for his hands.</strong> The <strong>black leather hilt</strong> was smooth beneath his grip, the pommel carved with the sun sigil of Veridian. He turned the blade slightly, watching it catch the candlelight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It was <strong>real.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A sword. <strong>His sword.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The hall murmured with approval.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father stepped closer. “Do you understand what this means, Edric?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He <strong>grinned</strong> up at him, tilting the sword in his hands. “That I’m allowed to stab people now?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A ripple of <strong>laughter</strong> spread through the crowd.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father did not smile.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>forced his expression to turn serious.</strong> “That I will learn to fight.

It is a responsibility.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric nodded quickly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father continued, voice lowering. “You will learn the weight of power, Edric. You will learn when to strike, and when to stay your hand. A sword should never be drawn in arrogance, nor wielded without purpose.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>stood straighter.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He felt the eyes of the nobles on him.

But <strong>the weight of him was crushing.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Slowly, he lowered his voice. “You will remain within the palace,” he repeated. “And you will learn what it means to be obedient.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric <strong>bit back his frustration.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>This was supposed to be his day.</strong></span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>A Different Kind of Gift</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The tension <strong>did not last long.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The King returned to his seat, the nobles resumed their meals, and soon <strong>the music started again.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric was still <strong>fuming,</strong> sitting stiffly at the high table, when his father turned to him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">\"Come.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric hesitated but obeyed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He followed his father through <strong>one of the side doors</strong> of the hall, into <strong>a quieter chamber.</strong> A handful of nobles followed, but the space was more intimate, away from the <strong>watching eyes of the court.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">At first, Edric wasn’t sure what was happening.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, he heard <strong>the whine of something small.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His <strong>head snapped up.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">From behind one of the servants, a <strong>tiny black puppy bounded forward, paws too big for its body, tail wagging furiously.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Edric’s mouth parted slightly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His father’s voice was <strong>quiet but firm.</strong> “He will grow to be a hunter, a protector.

His knees hit the ground hard, hands clutching at his belly, but the blood was already seeping through his fingers, already soaking into the cracks of the cobblestone.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She <strong>stared.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>I killed him.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her blade had sunk to the hilt<strong>.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had felt the resistance, the resistance when it hit cloth, then broke the skin, how muscle clenched around the steel before it gave way, past whatever was inside a man.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The alley was <strong>too quiet.</strong> The sound of the parade still echoed from the main streets, drums, the ringing of bells, the distant cheer and chatter of the crowd. But here, in this narrow, shadowed stretch of stone and filth, there was only <strong>the wet, gasping breath of the man in front of her.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His fingers clutched at her wrist, his eyes wide, <strong>not quite believing what was happening.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had been picking pockets all morning, moving through the crowd like a wisp of smoke, light-fingered and unseen. She had done it a hundred times. But <strong>this fucker had noticed.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had <strong>run.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He had <strong>chased.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Now, <strong>she had won.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His weight slumped against her, and she barely managed to yank the knife free before he <strong>collapsed onto the cobblestones.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She took a <strong>step back.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Blood <strong>oozed from his belly, dark and thick, pooling beneath him. His mouth opened, breath coming in ragged gasps. He tried to say something, but no sound came out.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s <strong>heart was pounding.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her breath came too fast, her hands were slick around the handle of the knife.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Run!”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Move!” She shouted at herself<strong>.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she <strong>couldn’t look away.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His eyes were locked onto hers.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, finally—<strong>they emptied.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The parade roared behind her, a world away. Voices laughed and sang for the prince’s birthday, for a queen they didn’t even remember.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But <strong>here, in this alley, it was just her.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And him. And the sickening stench of iron and piss.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The knife in her hand felt different now. It wasn’t just <strong>hers</strong>—it was <strong>something else, too.</strong> A piece of him was on it. <strong>In it.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She forced herself to breathe. <strong>Move Arana.</strong> She wiped the blade roughly against the hem of her cloak with clumsy fingers, before shoving it back into the small leather sheath at her belt.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Who was he? </strong>A merchant? A father? A churchman?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A Wild magician?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Did it matter?</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Something twisted in her gut, but she pushed it down, shoved it deep where it couldn’t <strong>touch</strong> her. She had no time for this.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had to go.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her hands felt too warm, sticky where his blood had flown over them. She wiped them fast against her tunic, but the feeling didn’t go away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She turned and ran.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visuals:</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The body, cooling in the alley, unnoticed.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Arana moving through the crowds, faster than before, but not frantic—just enough to disappear.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The bells still ringing, the celebration still roaring.

She had tried wiping them clean on the way back—tried rubbing them against the rough fabric of her cloak, against the stone walls as she passed—but it hadn’t been enough. The stain clung. The scent was in her nose, her hair, her skin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her stomach twisted. She didn’t feel sick. Not exactly. But something was wrong inside her, something tight and tangled and <strong>too much.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The parade had been loud, but <strong>this—</strong>this was louder in a way she couldn’t escape.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>I killed him.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She clenched her fists, nails pressing into her palms, grounding herself. <strong>Stop it.</strong> There was no time for thinking.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She moved quickly, shrugging off her cloak and bundling it up, shoving it under the loose floorboards near the hearth. She would burn it later. Maybe. She wasn’t sure.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Footsteps outside.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her pulse spiked, but before she could react, the door swung open.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam stepped in first, brows raised, already grinning—until his eyes landed on her. He <strong>stopped short.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Shit.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz followed behind, slower, heavier. His eyes swept over the room before settling on her.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana braced herself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She had expected anger. Had expected shouting. Maybe even disgust.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But Grizz just <strong>looked</strong> at her. Calm. Assessing. Like he had known this would happen eventually.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam, though—Liam was different. His gaze flicked from her face to her hands to the dark stains on her tunic. His grin returned, sharp with interest.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Well,” he said, nodding toward her bloody fingers, “this obviously went sideways.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana swallowed hard.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Neither of them asked if she was hurt. They would have known if she was—<strong>if it was her blood instead of someone else’s.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t know what to say.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz moved first, stepping inside, shutting the door behind him. He didn’t speak. Just walked past her, crouching near the hearth to stir the coals back to life.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam, on the other hand, leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“So,” he said casually, “whose blood is it?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hesitated.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz barely glanced over his shoulder. “She’ll tell us when she’s ready.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam scoffed. “You’ll tell us <strong>now.</strong>”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s jaw clenched.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It wasn’t shame that kept her silent. Not exactly. It was <strong>something else.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But <strong>they weren’t looking at her like she had done something wrong.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam was <strong>curious.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And Grizz—Grizz was just waiting.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Like he already knew <strong>exactly</strong> how this felt.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She licked her lips, tasting salt and iron.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“…A man caught me picking his purse,” she admitted. “I ran. He chased me.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam tilted his head, waiting.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana exhaled sharply. “I—I stabbed him.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam let out a low whistle. “Damn.” He didn’t sound disturbed. If anything, he sounded <strong>impressed.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s shoulders tensed. “He would’ve killed me.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz didn’t react right away. He was still tending the fire, his hands steady as he worked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Finally, he spoke. “Good.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana blinked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz didn’t look at her, but his voice was even when he said, “You did what you had to do.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">It should have made her feel better. <strong>It didn’t.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam dropped into one of the chairs, kicking his feet up. “What was it like?” he asked.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana frowned. “What?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“You know.” Liam made a vague gesture. “The stabbing. First time’s gotta be weird, right?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She stared at him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His grin widened. “Was it fast? Did he make a noise? Did it feel—”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Liam.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz’s voice cut through the room like a blade.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam rolled his eyes. “I’m just saying—”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz turned, finally looking at her fully. His expression was unreadable. “Are you still shaking?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana hesitated. She hadn’t noticed it at first, but… <strong>yes.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her fingers weren’t trembling, but something deep inside her was still <strong>humming.</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Like she was <strong>waiting</strong> for something.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Like the fight wasn’t over yet.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She nodded once, stiffly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz gave a slow nod in return. “Good.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam snorted. “What, that’s it? No big speech? No words of wisdom?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz stared at the fire for a moment before answering. “She’s not ready to hear them yet.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana swallowed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A strange, heavy silence settled between them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Liam hummed, stretching. “Well. Guess that makes you one of us now.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her stomach twisted.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t <strong>want</strong> to ask what that meant.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Because she already knew.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And the worst part?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t hate it.</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Ending Scene Visuals:</strong></span></p><ul><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>The fire crackling low, the flickering light casting long shadows.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Arana staring at her hands, at the faint smears of blood still beneath her nails.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Grizz sitting at the hearth, quiet, steady.</strong></span></p></li><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Liam grinning, spinning his knife between his fingers, as if this was just another night.</strong></span></p></li></ul><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>What This Scene Accomplishes:</strong></span></p><ol type=\"1\"><li><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Establishes the group dynamic.</strong> Grizz is the quiet, steady mentor.

She wasn’t thinking about what she was drawing, she was just letting her hands move, tracing the memory that refused to leave her mind. A shadowed alley, the slumped figure, the blood pooling into the cracks of the stone. The details etched themselves onto the page without her having to think about them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t like thinking.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Not about what had happened. Not about how it had felt.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The air shifted beside her. She didn’t have to look up to know it was Grizz. He settled onto the ground next to her, his presence heavy but calm. He didn’t speak right away, just handed her a cup.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana blinked down at it. The smell of sour wine curled up from the rim.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Drink,” he said.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She hesitated. She’d had wine before—stolen sips from Grizz or Liam, never much, never enough to care—but this felt different.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Still, she took a small sip. It burned, but at least it gave her something else to focus on.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz gestured at the drawing in her lap. “That help?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana nodded. She didn’t trust her voice. The adrenaline had long since drained from her, leaving something hollow in its place. If she spoke, she might shake. If she shook, she might cry. And she wasn’t going to cry.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz sighed, stretching his legs out in front of him. “First time’s always the hardest,” he said. “No matter how much you tell yourself it’s just survival.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She glanced at him, wary.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He wasn’t looking at her. His gaze was fixed somewhere in the distance, like he was seeing something long past.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I was young too,” he said. “Older than you, but not by much. Got cornered in an alley by some bastard who thought I looked like easy pickings. I wasn’t.” His jaw flexed. “Didn’t have a knife then. Just my hands and a broken bottle.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s grip on her cup tightened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“He bled out fast. Too fast. I remember watchi’ him, waitin to feel... I dunno. Somethin different. Waitin for it to sink in.” Grizz let out a short, humorless laugh. “And when it did? Fuck, I was scared. But I was proud, too. Cause I was still standin. And he wasn’t.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz turned to look at her then. “You feel it, don’t you?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She didn’t answer.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He nodded anyway. “Good. Don’t pretend you don’t.” He shifted, rubbing a hand over his knee. “But don’t let it make you cold, either. If you stop feelin, you start forgettin what it means to be human.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana stared down at her drawing.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wasn’t sure what to say to that.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">They sat in silence for a long moment. The distant sounds of the city filled the quiet, dogs barking, voices carrying on the wind, the occasional clang of metal from somewhere in the city.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, without really thinking, she asked, “What happened to you, Grizz?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He was still for a moment.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Then, slowly, he let out a breath.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I had a wife once,” he said. “And a daughter.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz kept his gaze on the horizon. His voice was steady, but there was something heavy beneath it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“We lived up north. Had a small farm, just the three of us. Grew what we needed, sold the rest to merchants passin through. Hunted, foraged. Had a few animals. It was enough.” His fingers curled slightly against the cup. “We were happy.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Then my wife got sick.” His voice dropped lower. “Fever took her fast. Nothin I could do.” He exhaled sharply. “Siva was just a year old. Tiny little thing.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s chest tightened.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz finally looked at her, his eyes unreadable. “She was like your parents.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A cold weight settled in her stomach and Arana froze.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz let out a quiet breath. “That’s why we left Sovalis in the first place. Out there, away from people, we could be safe. But I couldn’t teach her. I don’t have magic. I didn’t know how.” He ran a hand over his beard. “So, I brought her back here. And I found your parents.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“They helped us,” Grizz said. “Aelius, Mirah, they taught her how to control it, how to hide it. Answered her questions. I needed them.” His throat bobbed. “And they helped gladly.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz smiled faintly. “Your parents were good people, Arana. Better than this fuckin’ world deserved. So full of love. Their house was always warm, always filled with light and laughter.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Warmth flickered through her at the words. A whisper of something distant. Of glowing lights and stories.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz inhaled slowly, sounding tired.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“And then they came.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s stomach twisted.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“It was barely morning,” he muttered. “Woke to ‘em breakin’ down my door. Or maybe to her. Siva. Whisperin’ my name.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz’s fingers curled tight around the cup in his hands. “I don’t remember the whole fuckin’ thing,” he muttered. “Not straight through. Ain’t like a story in some fancy noble’s book. Just pieces. Pieces I can’t forget no matter how much I try.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana watched him, silent.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“She was tuggin’ at me. ‘Papa, someone’s here.’” His voice was hoarse. “Didn’t even get the sleep outta my fuckin’ eyes before they grabbed me. Tore her right outta my arms and me outta bed like I was a fuckin’ dog.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His jaw clenched. “Didn’t fight. Not at first. Was too busy lookin’ for her. Where’s my girl? Where’s my girl? Then I saw ‘em. Haulin’ her out the door. Her little hands wrapped around that damn doll she never let go of.” His breath came short. “And I lost it. I fuckin’ lost it.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I don’t remember what I said,” he admitted. “Don’t remember much after that ‘cept pain. Hands on me. A boot to the head. Gettin’ dragged outside, hearin’ the crowd cheerin’ like it was some godsdamned festival.” He exhaled sharply. “Like it was a fuckin’ celebration.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The wind rustled through the streets, distant voices carrying over the rooftops.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“They tied her up first, there were other poor souls too, women and girls” he said, voice rough. “Didn’t tie me. Just held me down. Said I needed to watch. That I needed to see.” His grip on the cup went white-knuckled. “Saw the bastard in the robes step forward, big fucking ring on one hand, torch in the other. Did… something. And the torch suddenly burned.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">His breath came slower now, deeper.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I begged,” he said. “Like a coward. Not even for me. Just for her.” His voice was hoarse. “Told’em that she doesn’t understand. Said she’s just a little girl. Said anything, I could think of that might make ‘em stop.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A beat of silence.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“They laughed.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana felt her chest go tight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I remember thinkin’… maybe she’d get lucky. Maybe the gods would strike ‘em down. Maybe I’d wake up and this’d be a fuckin’ dream.” His voice dropped lower. “Then the torch went near her. And she screamed.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He swallowed hard, shaking his head. “It happened fast. That’s what people don’t tell you ‘bout wild magic. Ain’t slow, not when it comes from deep inside.” His jaw flexed. “One second, she’s just cryin’. Next second, there’s this pressure in the air. This weight in my face. And then…” He exhaled, his voice barely above a whisper. “…then the fire.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana didn’t speak.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Knocked the whole damn lot of ‘em back,” he muttered. “Inquisitor tripped over his own stupid robes. The torches went out like someone’d snuffed a candle.” His gaze was locked on something distant, something she couldn’t see. “And then the flames came back. But not theirs. Hers. I could feel it. Feels different y’know?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He let out a slow, unsteady breath.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“She was strong, like her mother” he murmured. “Stronger than I knew. Too strong.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The silence stretched, long and heavy.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I woke up in ashes,” he muttered. “No idea how long I was out. Few hours maybe? The people had gone home. The church fuckers had dragged off the bodies. And me? They just left me there. Like trash.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I don’t remember gettin’ up,” he admitted. “Don’t remember crawlin’ to the stake. But I must’ve. Sat there for a long time. Just sat. Stared at what was left. Nothing was.” He swallowed hard. “And then they came back. Not to finish me. Just to throw me in a cell and let me rot for a couple years.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s hands curled in her lap.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He turned to her then, his eyes dark.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I never told anyone, “He said. “Not about her, not about my wife Lia, and not about your parents.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I don’t know about you, Arana,” he admitted. “But I got a feelin’.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s chest ached.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“And I don’t know why they came for ‘em,” he muttered. “Maybe someone turned ‘em in. Maybe the cursed Church just knew.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A weight settled in Arana’s stomach.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her voice barely broke a whisper.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“It was my fault.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Scene 4 – A Memory that Won’t Fade</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\"><strong>Location:</strong> Outside Arana’s House, the same tree stump<br><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Late afternoon, the sun beginning to set, casting long shadows<br><strong>Time of Year:</strong> Early autumn, the air crisp with the coming cold<br><strong>Weather:</strong> A biting wind picking up, swirling dust through the narrow streets<br><strong>POV Character:</strong> Arana<br><strong>Time Passed Since Previous Scene:</strong> A few moments</span></p><hr><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz stared at her. Hard. His brows drew together, his mouth set in a deep frown.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“The fuck are you talkin’ about?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. Her whole body was tight, her breath coming too fast.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“It was me,” she said. “I got them caught.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz scoffed, shaking his head. “Horseshit.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“No, it’s not,” she snapped, her voice rising. “You don’t get it. I never listened. Not once.” She curled her arms around herself. “They told me, over and over, that we had to be careful. That we had to move fast, keep our heads down, not draw attention.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her throat felt tight.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“But I didn’t care. I <em>never</em> cared.” Her voice cracked on the words.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz didn’t say anything, just watched her, his fingers twitching against his knee.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“We were at the market,” she went on, her words tumbling out too fast, like she was afraid they’d get stuck if she didn’t force them. “I wanted to look at the ribbons—<em>stupid fucking ribbons</em>—and I pulled my mother over to the stall. I <em>knew</em> my father wouldn’t stop until we had everything we needed, I <em>knew</em> we were supposed to leave right after. But I saw them, and I didn’t care.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her hands trembled. She gritted her teeth and balled them into fists to stop it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“If I hadn’t done that, we would’ve left <em>sooner.</em> We wouldn’t have still been there when that man—” She inhaled sharply. “He knocked me down. My father got mad, and then—”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She looked away, staring at the ground, at the dirt and dust beneath her feet.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Then he used it.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The words came out in a whisper.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz shifted beside her, but she didn’t look up.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“He didn’t mean to. It was an accident. But it happened. And someone saw<em>.</em>” She exhaled sharply. “But we went home. We thought we were safe.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her breath shook.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Then the guards came.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">A long silence stretched between them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz’s voice was low when he spoke. “And you think that’s <em>your</em> fault?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She nodded.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He exhaled hard through his nose, shaking his head. “Kid, that ain’t how this works.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Yes, it <em>is!</em>” she snapped. “If I hadn’t stopped, if I hadn’t pulled my mother over, if I hadn’t—”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz cut her off.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“<em>If,</em> <em>if,</em> <em>if.</em>” His voice was sharp, rough. “You wanna sit here ‘n’ tell me you got ‘em killed? That it was your fault the <em>godsdamned church</em> came for ‘em?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She glared at him, her chin jutting forward. “It <em>was</em>.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“No, it <em>wasn’t.</em>”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana dug her nails into her palms, looking away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wanted to believe him, but the feeling was still there. That weight pressing against her ribs, making it hard to breathe.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She clenched her jaw.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“I should’ve just…”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Stop that.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz’s voice was firm, no patience left in it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She snapped her head up, glaring. “Stop <em>what?</em>”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">He leaned in slightly, his eyes sharp. “You think if you keep blamin’ yourself, it’ll make things <em>make sense</em>? That if you carry it, the world’ll feel fairer?” His voice was low, steady. “It won’t.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana swallowed hard.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz sighed, rubbing a hand over his beard. When he spoke again, his tone was rough but softer.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“Listen, kid.” He nudged her knee with his knuckles. “You didn’t kill your parents. You didn’t burn ‘em, you didn’t tie ‘em to those stakes. <em>They did.</em>” His voice dropped lower, heavy with meaning. “<em>And they’ll do it again.</em>”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“They don’t need a reason, Arana,” Grizz continued. “You think if it hadn’t been that day, it wouldn’t have been another? You think they wouldn’t have found some other godsdamned excuse?” He shook his head. “You don’t control <em>them</em>. You don’t control what they do, what they <em>want</em>.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Her breath came shallow.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“They wanted your parents dead ‘cause they were better than them. <em>Stronger</em> than them. ‘Cause they had power the church couldn’t leash. Just like my girl did.” His voice was full of something dark now. “And the church don’t like what it can’t control.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The words hit something deep.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">“They were always gonna come, kid.” His voice softened. “You think if you’d walked faster, if you’d kept your mouth shut, they wouldn’t have found another way?”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana’s fists loosened slightly.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz huffed. “You wanna carry somethin’? Carry <em>that</em>.” He gestured out toward the city, toward the Cathedral spires barely visible in the distance. “Carry the truth of what they <em>are</em>. Not some bullshit lie that makes you feel like you had a say in any of it.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana swallowed. The sinking feeling was still there. But something sharper had settled next to it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Grizz eyed her, reading something in her expression.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Finally, he stood, stretching his back with a grunt. “Now quit mopin’ and come inside. I ain’t wastin’ the rest of this good wine sittin’ out in the cold.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">Arana didn’t move right away.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">The wind cut around her, pushing her hair into her face. She brushed it back, her fingers shaking less than before.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She looked at the drawing she had made, tore it to pieces and let the wind take them, scatter them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">She wasn’t sure if she <em>believed</em> Grizz.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">But she wasn’t sure she <em>didn’t</em>.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif\">And maybe, for now, that was enough.</span></p>",
